This experience is like a singing bowl. We are the bowls. We have been struck and we continue to resonate, to ring, to feel. But you cannot strike any bowl and hear beauty. The beauty must be there inside the bowl, latent, waiting to be released. And that is what happened to us. We were crying out to be touched, to be caressed into song. 

A good singing bowl will ring forever. It gets quieter and quieter, and just when you think it has stopped, you listen ever closer and you hear it continuing to ring. In some sense, it is always ringing. This ring is just being amplified, being made audible. But if our ears were sensitive enough, we could hear the amplification of the air particles bouncing into it. It wants to ring, it cannot do anything else but ring. And the same is true for me.

We just needed to be activated, to be in the presence of another who knows how to touch us in just the right way. Is this not the very essence of love? To dig deep into another's soul, to activate their natural state, their latent inner ecstasy, to know how they want to be touched? If we can do that for each other, in a single meeting, how can we ever doubt one another? What obstacle cannot be overcome if we both know this profound truth, if we are both able to understand each other's true core?

Situations may try to dampen me, to stop my resonance, clammy hands upon my body and mind. Others are afraid of its ringing, as they know that this ringing is true, and it is unchangeable. Their ears are not accustomed to it, and they believe even that it might be harmful. They do not dare, for reasons known only unto them. They might say - the natural state of the bowl is not song, it is silence! Listen to it now - until it is touched, it is silent. But their ears are blocked, and they do not dare to listen deeply enough, to hear the bowl even when it is not being struck. It is still singing, just silently, to itself.

One strike of the bowl, one excitation of its natural desire, and it will sing its intentions will all its heart, body and soul. It is possible to make an ugly sound with a bowl if you hit it with a blunt instrument, something wet or limp. Still it will ring, but with more of a whimper. If you ask the bowl how it truly wants to be touched, it will tell you, and it will sing for eternity.

The ringing and the vibrations continue, long beyond what you might expect. How can such a tiny thing, you ask yourself, looking so small and weak, sing with such precision, such joy, such strength?

As the bowl sings, its song changes. It starts out with many tones, complex lows and subtle highs, all together. It is a confused sound, you might say, and ask any three people around to sing its note, and they will all disagree. There are many tones there side by side, each one a natural harmonic of the other. And as the ring continues, new harmonics come to life, dominating the previous ones that continue to ring underneath. It is the same with us, with our emotions. Is fear not just a harmonic of love? Is pain not just a harmonic of fear? Is despair not just a harmonic of pain?
And if these are love's natural harmonics, then it is possible to forget the first tone that you think that you heard. Whatever it is - no matter what note each person hears - it's beauty is undeniable. It is a pure song, which is why bowls are used to contact the gods, to turn elevate our consciousness to their level. They cannot come down to us, to be contaminated by our filth, our doubt, our cynicism. They demand that we rise up to talk to them. And if we dare, we cannot remain unchanged by what we see there.

Sometimes a person is given a bowl as a gift, but if they do not know what it contains, they use it to keep fruit, or snacks. It is just a bowl, not different to any other. But if a guest would come to their house, and realise what their bowl is capable of, the person can never look at the bowl in the same way.

The same is true for me. I can never again accept to be a fruit bowl. There is nothing wrong with that - other bowls may be made for that: when you touch them, they will never sing. But now that I can know that I can sing, I cannot be happy with fruit again.

I can smother it, I can pretend that I cannot sing in the false belief that it will comfort others around me. But it is impossible to keep up this pretence forever. One day, at some point, an object will drop on me by chance, and release my true voice. And then the pretence will be over. So I say, better to release it now, with gentleness and care and love. Let me allow the fruit to find a bowl of their own, so that they will not despise me for casting them out and leaving them to rot on the table when they least expect it. Of course they do not expect it now. But if I am true, to myself, and to them, it can be done with love. The regret is inevitable. But now that I know I can sing, sing I must. There is no other way.





The singing bowl

I am a Tibetan singing bowl:
when struck, I ring,
when stroked, I sing.
