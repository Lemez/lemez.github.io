I have been on a see-saw the last few days.

I'm not happy. I am unhappy. It is fake. Our relationship is fake - perfect on the outside. They put chemicals in apples these days that can make them look perfect on the outside, yet they are deeply rotten inside. This is our relationship. Daniela's veneer, her past, is causing this. And there is nothing I can do about it.

I know that separating will cause me tremendous heartache. But if it happens, I will have the tools to deal with it. I will meditate, I will sing, I will cry, I will heal. D will form another crust, I think. But I cannot concern myself with that. I must be strong, and follow what I know. What I know to be true, and irretrievable.

I could continue to eat rotten apples, when all the world thinks I am eating sweet ones. If I had not tasted what else an apple could taste like, I would have. But when I tasted this, I remembered how life had tasted before it all went sour. Before my cancer, before this marriage, before my life became a battleground, managing another's sadness.

After that second day, when I discovered how I feel about my marriage, I have cried my eyes out twice - once in front of a Finnish friend, Steina, on a street corner in Pondicherry.
Each time I talk about it, and even cry about it, I am understanding better what I want, what I feel, what I see. The second time I cried was this morning, doing the Bala Mantra. 

Yesterday she left, we talked. 

Despite  myself, I woke up this morning thinking of her. I didnt text her. Daniela is writing me sweet messages, that I can't really respond to in words. I cannot do the usual exchange of reassurances - I love you, I love you too, I miss you, I miss you too.

We always said the two of us that we were free to leave, both of us, at any time. I do not feel like leaving, just like separating, and still seeing them often. Perhaps I will stay in a different room, in Gurujis. That seems ridiculous though, it makes no sense. I really do not know if there is any way to do this other than a clean break.

I fell into a deep sadness this morning. I messaged Steina to come distract me, but she didn't. I remembered the mantra that Guruji had taught the two of us the day before, the mantra to remove obstacles. Nikil took the two us through it last night before she left. It seemed long, difficult, unreal.

This morning, I decided to try it at least once.

I went to Guruji's house, took my agarpati and went to his puja room, and performed the mantra. During the japam, the silent mantra meditation, I cried. I felt myself plunging downwards, downwards and then I cried, and I came back up. And as I came back up, I felt a peace and healing course through my veins. When I entered the room, I was down, but as I left it, I was full of gratitude for this opportunity in my life, to remake my life as I choose, to be authentic to myself.

I have no doubt that there will be plenty of painful moments when I regret this decision, when I feel that I have acted badly, but when I reread this, I hope that I understand why, and stand by my decision. To do otherwise would be to ignore the truth. I cannot do that, if I do that, I will die slowly on the inside. Better to make a clean break, and to live with the consequences.

I still believe in the sanctity of marriage, in the vision of a shared life, of a future of love and romance and mutual interest. There is no perfect partner, I know that, not her and not me.
But if we do become one, then it will be based around something. A mutual love and respect for something that is greater than us, that we know can transform us into gods and goddesses. In our moments of darkness, we can transform ourselves into divinities, and through that divinity, we can see again what luck and wealth we have on this earth.

I was blessed after the puja. I left, beaming, and saw Guruji. He invited me to sit with him, and talked long to me about prayer, peace and sound. He told me that each note of the scale - Sa re Ga Ma Pa Da Ni Sa - is one chakra, and this afternoon, waiting in the Immigration Office, I sang to myself this scale over the drone of the ceiling fans. As I did, I visualised each chakra, and I could feel my body vibrating accordingly.

THe mantra itself is sound, but performed silently. After you practise and practise, said Guruji, you do not need any physical practice any more. The mantra is within you, and you carry around its balance and peace with you always. The practice of sound is so strong, that the inner auralisation of sound can create the same effect, the same physical vibrations and hormonal response. If you practice singing silently, you can carry that song around with you, and it is as if the song is always inside you. The first step is to feel the power of the song out loud. And from there, you can become at eternal peace with yourself, just through silent song.

He talked about the oneness of the universe, about the god and goddess inside us all. There is no god greater than us. We are the God. We are one with everything, our body is a universe, it is the universe. If you want to taste a pot of rice, you take a single grain to your lips. 

I walked away from Guruji-s in pure sringara, walking ten feet tall. I feel as though I have been blessed by this wonderfully wise man, that through his practice, I can see some of what he sees. That through sound, I can achieve a state of true contentment.

In this way, he said, you can experience true bliss. I have seen a glimpse of it, I said, for a single moment. You must use this to open the door, he said.

This experience has been transformative, and what it incredible is that I feel it will continue to be, taking me to places I can scarcely imagine now. 

At first, I felt this experience as physical, visceral, ecstatic. I was beauty itself that we witnessed, and that made us feel as one.

Then it turned inwards, became a comparison with my current unhappiness and I understood why it had happened to the two of us - because we both desperately want someone to do this with, to talk of this beauty to in our lives, and there is noone. Others may like it, but they cannot feel it.

Daniela has no time for spirituality, she prefers to bring an atheist distance, borne from her childhood experience of forced church-going. Her way is distance - she has too much fear of closeness to even try such a thing. That is a shame, a real shame both for us and for us. Were she to be interested in new experiences, in trying out beliefs to see how they fit, she may be able to see how it could help us, and heal us. Alas.

And now the experience has transformed again, away from others, into myself. It has become my first transcendental meditative experience. I have experienced the deep meditation of sound before, both in the sound bath, and in the Tibetan bowl session, but not being a part of it directly, not in creating it with my entire body. And yes, we were creating that sound with our entire body, the entire body being an ear and a voice. Our bodies were singing, responding to one another, controlling the flow of energy, and when it was perfectly in sync, it was bliss. Bliss. Even the thought of it bring a state of pleasure that is hard to explain, and to understand. It was pleasure on a level that I have not known before.

And now I understand it as a door, both to self-realisation, and to true transformation. It is a door that will take me to new places, into new experiences. I have been given the Bala Mantra by Guruji. I understand that this is no small deal. I intend to honour it fully.

D and A are coming back the day after tomorrow. It will be hard. And I do not know what will be. Two days is still a long time, and anything can happen, bearing in mind the rollercoaster of the past few days. But whatever it is, I welcome it with open arms. This is the stuff of life. Of a life worth living.
