Dear Daniela, 

I know that you must be hurting as I am. I hope and pray that you find it in your heart not to hate me. I love you, and always have done. You did not believe me, and perhaps deep down still don't. 

All I have ever asked from you is that you tell me what you wanted when you did not find it in your life. That I feel that you never really have is down to one of two things: either you cannot tell me, or I cannot hear it. There is no blame attached in either case, it is just the sadness of growing apart.

Please know, that every suggestion, every idea, every little thing I gave to you was my love. If I didn't love you, I would not have told you that I did. If I didn't love you, I would not have cried to myself so much while you were away in Sri Lanka. If I didn't love you, I would not have written this letter to you.

The sages and the scientists agree on one thing: that there are many parallel universes that exist in this very moment. There is one universe where I tell you the things you want to hear with generosity and warmth, which you say, rightly perhaps, that I do not give you, that I no longer know how to give you. There is another one where you believe you deserve joy in your life, and seek it in yourself, and with me. There is another one where Alma does not demand your love all the time, but allows you to give to her when and where you want. In this universe, you are not afraid and overburdened, and you have time to be yourself, to understand your own innermost desires.

There is another world where your terrible childhood experiences did not happen to you, your father is still alive, you were not forced out of your home and your family destroyed.

I feel as though you love our little family, and feel an anger too that you cannot explain, and do not know where it comes from. Until you know this, I do not know how we can be together as a family.  You have been filled with a sadness since Alma was born. Now that she is nearly four years old, I wonder when the pain will lift. That it has not - that I couldn't pull you out of it by force of will - is the biggest failing of my life. Perhaps I do not have the strength, the selflessness, the will that I thought I did.

Externally, you are better, I can see that. Kalari has given you a purpose and balance that has been lacking in your life. But it is not enough. You do not love yourself. I pray to all the gods that you will learn how to, that you will forgive yourself one day for something that is not your fault. That you will learn to assume the best of everyone, that everyone around you only wants to do you good. That there is nothing to fear in this life, and everything to gain by not being afraid.

I will never forget how you loved and nurtured me when I had my cancer. I cannot begin to thank you for that. You helped me get through my darkest days, you never judged me, you just allowed me to be, to get through it on my own. Why can I not do the same for you, despite my best efforts? This question will haunt me for the rest of my life.

I think that if Alma was not here, things would be different. You would allow yourself to heal, to face your demons as I faced mine. But with her around, you do not feel that it is OK to be weak, that it is OK to have problems, that it is OK to fall down in order to pick yourself up again. Any attempt I make to help seems doomed to failure, until we have got to the place that we are in now, a place where I have run out of ideas and I do not know how to help you. I doubt that I can. Your only hope is to help yourself.

In the parallel universe where my love and desire to only help you has an effect, you admit your problems and seek help in addressing them. It becomes your number one priority, as you realise that without this, we cannot have a life together. But you do not do it for me, or for us - you do it purely for yourself. Perhaps you take some time off by yourself to deal with them. But for some reason, you cannot. I feel as though you have a built a world for yourself where Alma is everything, your sun and your moon, and want to sacrifice yourself for her, no matter what the consequences.

For her sake, you have pulled on an armour to tell her, and the world, that you are fine. Perhaps this has been your default ever since you came to the UK: a desire not to be pitied, not to be helped, to be independent and strong at all times to all people. 

That you are so strong and smart and beautiful is not in question - you are all of those things, as much now as when I fell in love with you. But what has changed since Alma was born is your courage - your courage to face the world, to face Alma, to face yourself. Perhaps your courage was only ever a facade that you pulled on to deal with your experiences. When Alma was born, that courage was stripped away by her dependency, by her unequalled love for you, and yours for her.

Please forgive me if this letter sounds to you harsh, or judgemental, or unloving. I do not intend it to be any of those: quite the opposite. But for some reason you do not seem to hear what I say to you, and I do not hear what you say to me. When I tell you I love you, you hear something else. When you tell me you are happy, I hear something else. Perhaps we are destined to misunderstand each other for the rest of our lives, unless there is some radical change. Coming to India, to this oasis of flowers and beauty and positivity was my idea of a radical change. It has not worked as I had hoped. I pray that you have another idea as to what we should do.

How can I love you so much and feel like this? Do you love me? Do you want to be with me? What are you risking by opening up to life? What hope is there for us if you do not?

I apologise if this letter is confused, or if you do not feel the love that I have invested in it.

In one of these parallel worlds, everything that I say above is wrong, and you do not feel any of the things I think you do. In this case, it is me who is at fault, for not seeing things how they really are. In which case I beg your forgiveness, and your love, and your pity.

With all my love,
