Over came Bogdan, the dreadlocked Russian philosopher.

He asked a simple question: Leaving your wife, is that good or bad?

Bad, I said.

So what do you want to something bad for? Just don't do it. Forget your ego and your love and all that, just continue doing the things that make you happy, like your music and your work and support your daughter.

Think about your daughter, he said. Would it not cause trauma for your daughter?

It would.

So why cause her any trauma when you don't have to. Fuck happiness. That is just ego. Do what you want in your life, but together with them.
