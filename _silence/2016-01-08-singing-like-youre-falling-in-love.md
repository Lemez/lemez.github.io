I am six months into my carnatic music practice, and beginning to understand some of its power.

I will try to explain, but inevitably, words fail. 

Music is life, sound is life. Those two together with another - well, that is love. I do not know if I love her, but I know that I love what we do together, I love to do that thing with her.

I cannot now imagine wanting to do it with someone else, or anything else with her. We will just sing, and fall in love with ourselves and the world at the same time.

This love is a love for the world, for the possibility of emotion, for the excitement of control, for the beauty all around us. I feel that this love awakens in me an appetite for peace, perhaps if this is what it is to become a guru, then I am lucky. I know that I am lucky, lucky to have experienced this, to know what is this indescribable joy, this purity, this extremity of emotion. Yes I can say that it is love, and perhaps that if it is not life itself, then it is the key to life. It is an intensity of a moment that perhaps the gurus talk about. If enlightenment is a path, then this is certainly a step. 

I feel high and spaced out at the same time. The blood is flowing through my body, the energy id flowing, everything is sharp and real and intense and immediate.

I feel bathed in my own warm blood, at perfect peace and serenity. I am afriad that it will leave me soon - I knwo it will. But some 15-20 minutes after completing the session, it is still with me. Perhaps that is why I am writing, to seek to prolong it even further.

They say that meditation allows you to experience the world in bliss. I dont know about meditation, but I can only say that this must be it. The integral yoga of the voice. I am energised deeply, yet the longer I get from the experience itself, the more it cools, subsides into somethng resembling fatigue. Perhaps it is this act of la petite mort, the spending of the enrgy that is causing this fatigue. As Sri Aurobindo wrote, to experience life in bliss is to nnow the artist's joy of inspiration, of perfection, and to be able to summon it at will, and then to experience it as a constant, every moment on earth blissful and perfect, every touch heavenly.

This is not glass half-full and half-empty stuff. This is glass overflowing, all the time. To know this state is to be eternally grateful. I know that if I distance myself from it, I will get frustrated with myself. Perhaps I will even begin to doubt its truth. But once you have expereinced this extreme, this truth, it is impossible to look at life again the same way.

Perhaps this is God. I certainly would not judge anyone who felt that they had found God whilst singing, deeply focussed on another's voice, trying to sing in perfect unison.

Yes, it was unison, perfect unison. It must be something of the thrill that singers in a choir feel. Except without consciously trying to sing anything, to remember notes. It was only a listening exercise.

As a listening exercise, what satisfaction it brings to be able to be in perfect sync with another. Even now as I sing back out loud again the SA RE GA MA PA DA NI SA, it nrings with it a return of the bliss, the happiness. I am smiling from ear to ear now, beyond, it stretches to the top of my head. I will have to stop writing for a bit to sing some more.

(Later)

My ears are open to every sound, every richness of colour, every shade of light. Is this what dharma feels like? It is that same feeling returning from holiday in the sun to work. For two days, nothing can touch you. It is almost as itf the pupils are dilated to catch more light. You lvoe the world.

Yes, to be in love is to be attentive to another, to be in sync.

I am singing together with someone else. We sing together, nothing more than scales. We sing them slowly, attentive to each note, each movement, each exhalation. We focus inwards on our breath as we sing, and seek to sing exactly the same as the other, to anticipate their precise decision in advance, how will they attack the note, will it elide from one to another, where will an accent fall, which note will a glissando start from, when will a note be stressed, when it wil fall silent to support another.

{The next day}

That was yesterday. I saw her again today, we sang together again. We were both looking for the same synchronicity, the same apparition to come to us. When it didn't, she asked me outright: "What's wrong with you today?" We cut the session short, smoked a cigarette and talked. "I felt butterflies yesterday," she said. "It was the most intense experience of my life. I told my friend about what happened, and he said it was a kind of love-making." 

Now my skin is tingling, my heart racing, my senses are completely open. If I think about her, I wonder again what love is. If it is not love, then what is this feeling? Why are there not more words to explain this feeling? I feel full now, blissful, blissed out in the Sri Aurobindo sense. My blood feels warm, hot. I was aroused when we sang together, I won't deny it. It was so visceral, so physical, that my entire being responded. Now, my entire body is singing. Every organ, every blod vessel feels electrified, alive. I am experiencing ecstasy. Is this not the yogic bliss that the sadhus speak of?

Now I am stunned, I don't want to talk to anyone, to hear a single word that could curtail these waves of bliss. Bliss - I do not think I could ever have used that word before, I did not know what it means. It would have seemed excitable, meaningless. But now this is undoubtedly it. I know what true emotions are. I felt them with my cancer, the despair, the fog of why. And now I have been awakened, and I feel them again. 

Who is this girl to me? I hardly know her, and yet the strength of feeling is such that I can play almost any narrative in my head and it seems almost possible.

She said the words I didn't dare to. It was an orgasm, the strongest I have ever known, an out of body experience, produced by ourselves, for each other. As we sang, we gave gifts to each other, waiting, carressing. Yes, it was intensely erotic. It was more than that. The most powerful moment I have ever experienced. We made love with music, with our voices. Had I not experienced this, I would not have believed it to be possible. 

Today, as we could not sing, we talked, about what had happened, about music, about other things.
We are both confused by this, I know. What was that thing, and what place does it have in our lives? Does it mean anything beyond the fact that we were both given an experience that will stay with us forever? Why did it happen, now, to us, here?

Finally words ran out. We hugged. She left. She is leaving for good the day after tomorrow. Luckily for me. I need a drink.


==== part 2
 An hour or so after the above, I run to a cafe. I cannot bear to talk to anyone, to be dragged into their mundane world. I feel as though I have stumbled across the most precious diamond on earth, but if I look away for a second, it will disappear.

 In the cafe, I reluctantly greet acquiantaces, still dazed, stoned, and put the headphones back on, where the tanpura drone, the constant accompianiment to our singing, has been playing ever since the class. The feeling comes back as I listen, it surges back ever stronger. There is no doubt that these frequencies, this sound is feeding my brain, mmy body, giving me kinetic energy, feeding the part of my brain that now sings but a few days ago did not even know that it could wake up.

 I am afraid even, in this cafe, to drink anything, lest it change my mood, lest it give another energy and interfere with this one. I feel like I have tuned into a hidden radio frequency by chance, one that does not appear on any dial, and has been only been spoken of by gurus, and monks. On the way I wondered if this was love, I now know that it is, and it isn't. It is not here, it is itself. The headphones are on loud, now this drone, pulsating, erotic in and of itself. It stays constant this energy, repeating itself for ever, but it moves gently, curling around my body. as i observe the physical sensation of this bliss, I feel it first in my shoulders. They are on fire. The muscles tense, or at least they have the feeling of tension. Perhaps this is the anxiety of the experience. It si making me anxous in some ways too as I do not know what it means and I am terrified of cheating on Daniela. 

 I feel as if, were it to happen, I would have a child with her. I dont know why this thought comes to mind, but it is as clear as day. If I would be forced to leave Daniela, to have a new life in India with her, I would have failed as a father. But if it comes to this, it will break my heart, it will be impossble for me to have a pure life with her. Now it is pure, because now I have everything. Once false move could bring my world crashing down on its head. It is not as if this has not been coming with Daniela. We have not known real love, or intimacy, or mutual understanding for a long time. But this electricity, this overwhelming force? I have never felt with Daniela. She was in the right place at the right time, and I fell in love when I realised she could be the mother of my children. Yet things have not turned out the way I hope. We have been in India one year, and sometimes I feel she will never see the world as I do. Perhaps she doesnt have to. Perhaps this is a test of strength, a test of will, a test of maturity. I know that nothing will happen between now and the day afte tomorrow, when she leaves. I will not allow it. And no doubt, this truth that I feel now will fade. But to live without the promise of ever feeling it again? How can I turn away from this feeling, now that I have felt it?

How would I live in India, married to an Indian? She is so young, so alien to me. Yet this syncronicity, this intensity is undenaible. It is both lust and a million miles from it, lust only in its basest form. If this is what I feel now, what would the sex be like? I can imagine.

I do not fancy her in the typical way. Yet she is mesmerising, she has these enormous eyes that drill holes in you. Yet when we sang, it was with my eyes closed.

I am developing a lump in my throat. I think the enormity of what is going on is occurring to me. Shit shit shit shit shit shit shit. I feel very nervous now, like I want to avoid her.

This was not in the fuckign script. Especailly while D and A are away. But why has it happened now, innocently through msuic practice, just while I am in India without my family for the first time ever. Could it be that I am channeliing my secret desire for a new life, for a better life, into this music, this culture that D does not understand, and perhaps does not want to?

My writigin is rushign out, full of typos, demonic, unhinged. This is frightening. My wirst nightmare and hte thing I have been dreaming about for years. 

I have only felt something even close to this before once - with paola, in ITaly. We had sex 10,12,14 times in one nigth, I dont remember, as soon as we were done we started again, until there was no sperm left to come about, jsut a pure, transparent fluid. I was hard always for her. I was prepared to move to Italy to be with her, but she was unstable, mentally ill, and t was not to be. But what an affair it was. 

Now that I have tasted this affair, f course I cannot forget it. And now that I feel this, lets call it waht it is - this chemistry, what can I do about it?

Now that I remember, I perhaps have felt somethign liek this once - when I was 16, with Laura Gibson. I remember tha we had broken up - I was off on new adventures around the world, and we could nto be together that summer. This is that same feeling, that same ovewheleming love. It did not last though, that is true. But that physical pain I felt in the cafe in Victora that day when we met again ate me up, consumed me like a fire. It was my first love, one that I have thoguht all my life was so intense only because it was the first. Now I knwo that is not true. And this I will neve be able to forget, no matter how mch i run from it.

that day, as we said goodbye for the last time, I bit her on the wrist, so hard that I drew blood, She wanted me to, and I wanted to. It was like a tattoo given with the mouth, an act of eternal love. We knew that it was over, but that it had formed us both. I feel now fo rhte first time in my life that I want to talk to her again, to see if I recall what she does.

What did that moment mean to her, and how has she felt about it since? Has it ever come back into her life, at a moment when she least expected it?

Will this feeling not go away? Before I wanted it to stay, to cherish it, as I learn to dowith my depression during my cancer. But now, it is here, staying, rekindled only by a conversation that we had today. the logner it stays, the more it means trouble. Because while I feel it, I cannot deny it.

I am drinkign lemon, honey an ginger in hot water. It feels so strong, the flavours now, the taste, sour,sweet,pepper. The honey in particular tastes sweet, as sno doubt woudl she. 

WHy has she been brought here, to me, now? Becasue what ever happens, my life has just got a whole lot harder.

The authenticity that I talk about, about not making compromises in my life, surely it only has one conclusion on my realtiosnhip. I have tried, tried, tried. I feel like crying as I write these words. Perhaps this is the beginngi of the end, no matter what happens. Shuba is young, she has hope and appetite for the world, desire, peace, love. All the things I would hope to find in Daniela, but have vanished since Alma was born.

What I recognised in that single singing session was a love for beauty in life. It was a total absence if fear. I am a good person, or at least I think I am. If I continue to exepct nothing from my relationship apart from to be left alone and to share meaningless moments, am I  a better person for it? I will support her financially, to the best of my ability.

A feeling this strong that builds up in me will weaken me, not strengthn me. I need to take these headphones out. Now.

It is like the doors of the world have been opened. All my fears about my future life are now out of the bottle. Is there any putting it back in?
