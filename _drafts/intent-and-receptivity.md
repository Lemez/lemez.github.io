What Exactly Do You Mean? 
Intent and Receptivity as a Framework for Voice Music and Music Medicine 

Music medicine and sound healing lie at the interface between acoustics and sound studies, psychology, music, medicine, anthropology, performance studies, music therapy and theology.

This study will seek to establish an optimal philosophical framework for understanding the dynamics of music medicine, with an emphasis on the use of the voice, and an examination of its application with autistic children. 

I start with the hypothesis that successful sound healing, or transmission of any profound musical experience, is dependent primarily on two things: the intent of the healer and the receptivity of the patient. Sound, therefore, is the merely the physical means by which the former's intent is transmitted to the latter - "a carrier of consciousness" (Goldman), with a particular set of properties that make it uniquely effective.

Alongside these three constituent parts - the intent of the healer/performer; sound as a vehicle of transmission; the receptivity of the recipient - I will examine the effect of sound healing / receptive music therapy on autistic children as observed in India.  

This division into four areas plus a conclusion would seem to suggest a natural breakdown for the study into five sections, with the fourth bringing the previous three together in practical application, and the final section bringing together the study in an attempt to tease out its meaning in a wider contemporary context.

The proposed chapters are described in more detail below:

1) The performer: the intent behind the healing/artistic process

	- Philosophy of Intent
		- The nine emotions or 'rasas' in the Natya Shastra and Classical Sanskrit sources, with special focus on creativity/love ('sringara') and 'bhava' - devotional intent
		- The concept of 'mukti' and its role as the key goal of South Indian ritual and artistic practice; artistic performance as a channel for divine beauty
		- music as a sacred practice - the 'wholly other' - within a historical context of world religions (music and medicine in the medieval Middle East: Avicenna, Al-Kindi, Saadya Gaon et al; Kabbala & Jewish mysticism; Gregorian chant in European Christian tradition; sound as worship in pre-Christian societies (the work of Iegor Reznikoff in acoustic archaeology and primitive cave paintings)
		
	- Application of Intent
		- the five elements (Earth/Fire/Water/Air/Ether) as a structure for healing, and a comparison of music medicine with haptic healing techniques such as reiki
		- healing as solo performance to an audience of one, within the context of contemporary performance theory

2) The vehicle: sound as a "carrier of consciousness"

	- Properties of Sound and the Voice
		- philosophical properties of sound in Vedas / Tantra; struck ('ahata') and unstruck ('anahata') sounds; "Om" as the source of creation; mantra daily practice and 'nada' yoga; Vedic sound as participative meaning in and of itself - construction rather than expression 	(Carpenter, quoted in Nevrin)
		- acoustic properties of sound within a music medicine context: frequency, dynamics, articulation, rhythm, timbre
		- physical properties of sound within the context of the electro-magnetic spectrum and its relation to light, matter and astronomy; 'the music of the stars' 
		- vibrational properties of sound and vocal production: Sanskrit speech articulation; cymatics (Chadli et al)

	- Applications of Sound and the Voice in Ritual Possession, Diagnosis and Healing
		- the precursor to ultrasound: diagnostic use of the voice in traditional body-scanning practices
		- ritual objects for sustained vibration, such as singing bowls in Tibetan Bon; gongs
		- the voice in the lunar cycle
		- vocal practice in water, Ganges - vibrations in water
		- the voice of the mother in childbirth as pain relief

3) The listener: receptivity
	- Listening through sound
		- The Body Is An Ear: phono-psychology and the physionomy of air and bone conduction, Alfred Tomatis et al; listening in the womb; sound as our predominant developmental and navigational tool
		- the art and philosophy of listening, R Murray Schafer et al
		- Body resonance: Chinese meridians, and their application with acupuncture tuning forks etc
		- the healing properties of high frequencies; whispering interactions between mothers and babies

	- The importance of sustained sounds
		- the theory of drones, modal music systems and the role of the tanpura in Carnatic music
		- the search for universal frequencies: Schumann resonance
		- the receptivity of ritual possession through ceremonial rhythmic drumming in rural Tamil Nadu / the theyyam rituals of northern Kerala
		
	- Listening beyond sound
		- psychology of receptivity within the context of contemporary well-being practice (sources tbc) and psycho-acoustics
		- the implications of soundless listening and recitation in Tantric mantras
		- oral traditions of 'knowledge transfer' in the gurukkul system of South India, with reference to musical (Carnatic) and non-musical examples (kalaripayattu) 

4) The results: sound healing in Autism
	- Why Autism in particular?
		- autism as a laboratory for the human mind
		- history of autism, psychological and pedagogical approaches  
		- psychophony and evidence of an 'intent and receptivity' framework in autism
		
	- Practical Applications
		- overview of sound healing as a discipline in receptive music therapy  
		- overview of contemporary music therapy practices in India
		- Neurological Music Therapy and its cognitive and linguistic methods  
		- meaningful quantitative and qualitative measurements of outcomes
		- carnatic music / bhajans for autism with guru Bombay Jayashree
		- results and discussion of practical experiments at a specialist autism school in India

5) Conclusion: Where Now?
	- Sound at the Edges of Intent
		- combining sound and intent at the extremes of the spectrum of intent: Tesla's (et al) experiments with sonic weaponry 
		- chrono-biology and the principle of entrainment
		- latest research in sound and medicine: sonocytology in cancer treatment, etc

	- Music Medicine & its relation to the contemporary sonic world
		- the disappearance and reemergence of music medicine in the Western world
		- the body as a source of drones; the predominance of drones in the urban soundscape as a trigger for the global shift away from harmonic music back to modal music
		- the resurgence of music medicine within this context
		- attempt to form an overarching framework for music medicine
		- can this framework inform understanding of the dynamics of popular music and performance, and beyond that, as a framework with which to navigate our sonic environment?

The study will consist of four parts: an exploration of what intent and receptivity mean in the light of historical music medicine sources (Vedic and Classical Sanskrit, Arabic, Old Church Slavonic, Greek, Chinese); a detailed discussion of what both performance and listening are in contemporary philosophical and physiological terms, with special reference to Carnatic vocal tradition; an analysis of healing techniques as practised by   ; a practical exploration of how the techniques discussed actually work with autistic children at a special needs school in Pondicherry, India. 

Section 1: Historical Overview of Intent and Receptivity in Sacred Music
Why is it that so many healing traditions either have their roots, or remain, in a sacred context? Is secular healing through sound and music even possible? Within the literature of sound healing, sound is "a carrier of consciousness" (Goldman), connecting a healer's intent with the physical and energetic bodies of a patient. Sound acts physically on the patient's body, being carried to the brain through air and bone conduction (Tomatis). 

Section 2: Performance and Listening as a vehicle for Intent and Receptivity in one Sacred Music Tradition: the Carnatic Vocal Art of South India

In the Carnatic tradition of South India, vocalists are renowned for their improvisation abilities, sustained over three or more hours at a 'katcheri' (concert). How do the performers achieve such sustained levels of technical achievement over such a long period? Is there a relationship between their intent and their performance? They are taught to remember the notes of a raagam physically, by locating them in energetic centres - chakras - in the body, and they improvise by seeking to reproduce the physical, vibratory sensation rather than the note itself. 

All healing traditions are modal, rather than harmonic. 

What is it that makes sound healing work, either as an agent of biological change - verifiable by quantitative neurological, endocrine or cytological evidence; of psychological change, verifiable by qualitative patient examination; or of physiotherapeutic change, as verifiable by an empirically-evidenced improvement in sensorimotor, linguistic or cognitive abilities? 


I propose to examine the framework of intent and receptivity as a means through which to understand the relationship between a sound healer and his/her patient.

What does intent mean, and what 

My interest is to understand: can the intention of a producer of sound affect the listener?
