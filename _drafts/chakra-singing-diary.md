Chakra practice

Notes from this morning, 13 Feb 2016, 730-830 am, G#, Mayamalavagowla

SA
 chakra muladhara will not resonate unless spine is exactly straight.
pratising with normal sitting (ie my lazy) spine, and then straightening it while you sing Sa brings the most amazing resonance. You feel the spine as a transmitter of sound throughout the body. the entire body becomes alive through the spine, quite incredible. Head position, tilted back, forward etc changes tone sound and vibratory stregnth.

To find the optimum vibration of this chakra - this is a superb way to check posture exactly for singing, and to release tension from the throat, the chest, the neck.

If all is relaxed and straight, my balls tingle furiously. The tongue is free in the air, not vibrating. All teeth are vibrating at the same rate.

RI
 the lifting of the tongue causes the air flow, and vibrational pattern to start at the roof of the mouth, from where it flows down the back. It is a very noticiably different feeling from Sa, a reverse pattern of flow. The tongue rises to create a back channel air flow. Vibratory flow shifts from the spine to the back of the rib cage. Tongue is clamped on top teeth like a valve, teeth vibrate strongly. I touch my teeth with my tongue as I sing to see which teeth are vibrating.

Bottom incisors (central) are vibrating the most, whole bottom jaw vibrates more than the top jaw, which is being dampened by the tongue.

GA
This is hard to get to resonate, until I support with diaphragm, with strength.
This must be a rock in the scale, very solid place of resonance - belly. It must vibrate with force. With lower belly breathing and support, it comes to life. 

Therefore, tendency on RI to suck in belly in order to 'pull backwards towards svadisthana' must be fought: in fact, with good diaphragm support, RI will resonate at the back just as well, and then GA will be there too, without having to reset breathing.

GA articulation - hard G - I am thinking of Judykael's hand movement, the snake-head or fist flipping back - encourages the GA as a rock, a place of solidity, not to be moved.

MA and PA
Not explored much, started to feel them, need to spend more time investigating.
