I have just completed a short four-day course in sound healing with Aurelio from Svaram. When I first cam across him, it was as a musical instrument maker. His gongs, chimes, percussion instruments and stones are amongst the most resonant, beautiful sound-making instruments I have ever come across.

I subsequently found out he is a healer, and as I continue my investigations into music and medicine, it was a gift to see this short course coming up when I was free.

Sound healing and music therapy are not the same thing. Music therapy is frequently understood in a Western context as related to psychology - most music therapy training in the West involves psychological frameworks, and most music therapists are qualified psychologists.

This has never made much sense to me. I understand music, and by extension, sound as a magical, mystical practice that brings together performance, ritual, art and communication, and the formalised Western context has little room for magic or mysticism.

And so it was with great excitement that I discovered, over the period of these four short days, what sound healing is, and what role it can play.

First, a word about experiences. I am having ever deeper experiences through sound here. My first was at a sound bath, Aurelio's immersive concert where the audience lie on the ground and are 'washed' by the musicians with their instruments. Over the course of an hour, I went in and out of dreaming, and woke up at the end of the session deeply refreshed and calm.

The next, deeper level was at the <a href="{{bowls[0].url}}">Tibetan bowls workshop</a> with Michael Ormiston in London, where I was taken into a delicious state of vivid experience by the sound of Tibetan singing bowls, those magical musical instruments that make the warmest, most enveloping sounds you will ever hear.
