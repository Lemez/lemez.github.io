Live music commissioned for the Other Seder at the Tricycle Theatre, directed by Mark Rosenblatt for Yad Arts and JCC London.

The brief: write music for the four short plays that make up the evening. We were lucky to put together an ensemble of fantastic musicians for the show – Ben Davis on cello (Basquiat Strings), David Lasserson on viola (Gogmagogs), Genevieve Wilson on cajon (ensemblebash) and Paul Tkachenko on bass.
