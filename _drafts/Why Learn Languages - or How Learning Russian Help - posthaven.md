Why Learn Languages - or How Learning Russian Helped Me Chat Up Girls
Friends, you know me as someone who believes in learning languages. I'd go so far as to say I believe in languages themselves: learning a language as being the single best thing anyone can do to understand the world around them better.

It is fashionable these days to say that we don't really need to learn each other's languages - that technology has made it unnecessary. We can get any web page translated into our mother tongue at the click of a button, and it is not fanciful to think that before long, aural and vocal implants connected to computers will mean that we can not only read each other's languages, but understand and speak them too.

Where - until this tech-driven utopia comes - language learning is still seen as necessary, the conversation usually revolves around how useful it is. The point or otherwise of learning a language is measured purely in econometric terms - how practically useful this new skill might be in terms of employment and income. Hence the fashion in UK schools to ditch French and German and teach Mandarin Chinese instead.

For a while in the past decade, compulsory foreign language learning was dropped in schools in favour of more 'economically advantageous' subjects - Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics. I'm not saying that our schools should or shouldn't be teaching Chinese, French or German - that is not the point. But if we are going to measure the benefits of studying one thing or another,to use only economic factors as a point of measurement is to miss the point entirely.

I was lucky enough to grow up in a house where languages were the norm. We spent holidays in Israel with cousins who spoke English, and they came to stay with us. My parents thought language was important enough for me and my sister to bring a French au-pair to live with us when we were babies. She left when I was two, but when I got to school, I found French easy. Soon I started to seek out opportunities to learn other languages - German, Russian, Japanese, Hebrew. Something incredible happened: the more languages I learnt, the more people I could speak to, and the more people I could speak to, the more interesting life became. 

Being born an English speaker is both a privilege and a disadvantage: a privilege because it allows us to be lazy. When we talk to other people: we both assume that they should speak in our language. It's a disadvantage for the same basic reason: we are lazy in our interactions with others. We assume that it is up to them to make the effort to decode us: we don't need to make the effort to decode them. And that would be fine if language was only a means of communication - a series of noises and signs
