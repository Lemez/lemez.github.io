Nava Rasa classes with Vinay Adishakti, 11 May 2016

Three types of emotions:
Soft emotions: in the lips, all with high pitched nasal sound
Middle emotion: transitory, middle of the mouth
Hard emotions: back of the throat

HASIA

History of storytelling, good vs evil.
Continues today in folk, cinema etc that evil is the one who laughs. 
This demonic laughter of the evil villain stereotype, noone does it.
Laughter starts with a giggle.

Giggle - starts with vocalizing nasally, before opening the jaw muscles.
Diaphragm pulsations. Laughter is percussive, rhythmic. 

Giggle is nasal, turning into laughter with open mouth.

Pitch: Starts high, descending
Pulsation: starts slower, increasing
Breath: single breath
Mouth: closed, moving to open mouth as giggle progresses to laugh
Duration: long

Must continue til the end of the breath to create the tension to result in real laughter.

Variations in laughter are essentially variations in rhythm.
cf: Crying, where each pulsation of the diaphragm is accompanied by a breath

Laughter as percussion ensemble: polyrhythmic laughter ensemble?
Marimba laughter.

This is about projecting intent: the actor's intent must be that the situation itself is funny. Then the audience will laugh too.

Actually what is performer doing? Maing a continuous moving facial mask sustained by the breath. That is it.

Laughter (initial facial mask, as we try to suppress the laughter):
Collect air in lungs, push from diaphragm into sealed mouth (forcing cheeks out), then release like a long fart, with diaphragm pulsations.



NB: if you are punched, you collect the air in the mouth too. Why? In order that the muscles don't tear, the air stopping keeps the muscle tension.

=====

2nd type of laughter - minimal sound with maximum tension
Suck in air through teeth, corners (like trumpet)
Tight stomach, crunched.
Tongue against top teeth;
No sound.
Start with giggle, open mouth to wide A.
Sustain all the way beyond end of breath.
Quick inhalation.
Always start new laugh with giggle.


====
All physical emotional representations, like laughter or words, are ways to express to others what we are feeling.

Laughter is supressed in our lives, we suppress full body laughter in almost all social situations. Only people who know themselves really laugh fully. Those who are repressed do not, or cannot. I myself haven't really laughed for years. I laugh with Joel, I remember. With Sasha? With very few people I really, really trust.
With Daniela, never.

We occasionally giggle together, mostly we smile. Never we laugh.
Keep the smile all the time.

Inhalation with a smile.


Scream - nasal

Adding one or two half way through the laughter

=========

VIRA - equilibrium
Uses a physical structure

Projected chest via arched spine

Great speakers have great balance of high, medium and low frequencies.

Ribcage and head resonators are the voice amplifiers:
ths allows the spine to be a vibratory device.
If you want to project, you MUST arch the spine to allow the body to be a resonator. VIRA achieves this.

Arched spine - says yes, confidence.
Not arched - doubt.

All chanting, singing is done with VIRA.

Nasal produces high frequencies; these PROJECT the sound

You can you trigger with MMMAAAAA, long M sets up Nasal
Sound is sweeter with high frequencies.

Anus muscles - low frequencies
Back - chest cavity

=======================
SRINGARA (love desire etc) - base for adbuda, vira, hasia

before HASIA, need to get SRINGARA

We borrow lip structures from others.

Historically, in courts, all smiling. Aesthetic basis of behaviour - global.

What is a smile? Warmest gesture a humna can give to another. I am no danger to you, come.

It is a mini facelift, allows all wrinkles to disappear, stretches, blood pumps to face.

cheekbones are main visual spectacle.

1) Air intake, slow inward hiss
2) eyes widen, forehead raises, as mouth opens, cheek muscles gradually back
3) tiny, almost invisble breath pulsations
4) release breath, and facial muscles stay open

Do not move your face indepenently of a breath - move only WHILE you breathe.

This really works - you feel inspired, loved up, whatever after doing this exercise.
