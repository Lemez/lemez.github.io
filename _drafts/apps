It was an honour to be asked to make tracks for Songify, the Youtube sensation, whereby two bedroom producers called the Jonas Brothers autotuned the news with great style and humour and made perfect little viral comedy videos. 

We were commissioned by Khush, later acquired by Smule, to compose nine tracks on this app, in varied styles – Rock, Waltzes and Country.

It went on to become the world’s no.1 free iPhone app on release in summer 2011. 

We later followed it up with work for two more apps: the mega-hit Autorap - and the slightly less-so Singing Santa (reworkings of Xmas hits - hey, everyone's gotta eat).
