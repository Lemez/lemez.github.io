Michel Thomas - observations and lessons

Learning is based on understanding and knowing.
What one knows, which is based on understanding, one will never forget.
Understanding means that the know/edge is organized and interconnected.
The evidence of understanding is the ability to generalize and to apply the know/edge to solve problems in different situations.

Why Speaking and Listening only works
"If you know how to spell, then you will also know how to write. And if you know how to write, then you will know how to read. It is exciting to see that after three days students who started with zero knowledge of the language will be able to read. And they will also be able to pronounce correctly what they are reading. They will know where to put the stress on words."

Course Structure
Five day course: in three days, followed up by two days practice. Followed up by 10 mins/day reading (Michel preferred that the reading be done without the use of a dictionary. Spending ten minutes a day was much more important and more effective than spending a few hours a week doing the same thing.)

Removing Tension - physical, associative
No physical, mental or spatial reminders of what we have referred to earlier as the Mind Prison. The room always included comfortable arm chairs. In Michel's office, there were comfortable leather arm chairs for both Michel and the learner. There were plants, a table and a lamp. Plants and/or flowers were an important ingredient in this ambiance. As far removed from a classroom, physically and psychologically, as one could get. In it we found no visual, no auditory, no kinesthetic or olfactory reminders of the traditional classroom. For example, in his ideal learning environment there were no desks and no blackboards or flip charts or overhead projectors. There was no smell of chalk or erasers or of magic markers. There were no school bells and no class schedules.

"I think that it is self-evident that these inner potentials [of every student] require the right environment in order to take off and soar. If not, they will remain just that, potentials, dormant perhaps, as they so frequently are in students within traditional classroom settings. This is why I am insistent upon a particular kind of milieu. I look for an environment defined by years of examined experience, because I look for the break-through that leads to tapping the learning potentials within each student. Now this is a tenet of my method: with a carefully wrought system administered under replicable conditions, a breakthrough will occur and stimulate those innate potentials."

Manner
A sense of calm and trust that permeated the atmosphere of the room, which was reinforced by his charming smile and gentle manner. As an observer on the outside looking in, one immediately had a sense of a deep connection already being established between teacher and student.

Teaching is an interchange involving explaining and responding, which leads to understanding and knowledge. Michel, the Master Teacher in every way, would always be aware of students' emotional states, blocks, prior traumatic learning experiences, etc. that could interfere or create tension and therefore negatively impact learning.

Connection
He would make immediate eye contact with the student or students, v important

State Course Goals
You are here to learn, and what you will achieve in a matter of a few days, three days, is that you will have acquired a solid, comprehensive knowledge of the entire structure and grammar of the target language, including all tenses including the subjunctive, together with a solid, practical and functional vocabulary which will enable you to converse, read and write in all tenses - without the need to memorize by rote, take notes or complete homework."

Removing Tension - mental
.. Without memorization - There is never anything to memorize.
.. Without learning by rote
.. Without the use of textbooks
.. Without taking notes - Notes are not allowed.
.. Without homework - Homework is absolutely not allowed - not even mental homework.
.. Without ever trying to remember anything.
.. The full responsibility for your remembering will be in the teaching - my teaching.

'They are listening to me and in listening to me, I am not telling them to relax really. I don't use the word "relax." They are in comfortable chairs, so I don't need to tell them to relax. I tell them that they will be exposed to a method where they are not to try to remember anything. The emphasis is on trying. Remembering is one thing, but don't try. Whatever you do, don't try to remember and I will tell them why. Because the responsibility for your remembering is with me. It is my job. Remembering is not your job. Not trying to remember immediately removes tension and brings about relaxation. So don't try. If I say that, then that immediately removes tension.'

If you don't remember something, it is up to me to know why you don't remember. It is up to me to know why you don't remember and to know what to do about it. So that process, what to do about your remembering is my job. Don't try to do it yourself. With this, I remove already all tension before I even start.


Initial Frames
- Course objectives
- What you will accomplish How this will be done Make yourself comfortable Let go of all tension
- Do not write or take notes. Do not try to remember.
- Remembering is the teacher's and not the learner's responsibility
- Give yourself time to think.
- Never get annoyed at yourself if you make a mistake.
- Let go of all expectations
- Learning should be accompanied by a feeling of great joy

Frames on remembering vs trying to remember
- There is nothing to memorize.
- Don't try to remember anything
- There is no memorization or rote learning.
- There is no trying.
- There is no making any effort to remember.
- One should not try to remember from one second to
the next.
- There is no trying to remember anything.
- Simply put, there is no trying.

Trying is a conscious process, whereas remembering is an unconscious one.
We can't emphasize enough the fact that learning and remembering occur in the now.
By not trying to hold on, we are able to stay in the now and to allow the automatic memory process to function.


Teaching Method
Michel's focus would always be on developing the practical understanding necessary to actually use the language correctly. He accomplished this without using grammatical terms other than noun and verb and adjective and without memorizing grammatical rules. Correct grammar was taught in the context of learning to speak the language correctly.

On Understanding
"What one knows based on understanding, one will never forget."

All learners know and I emphasize this that what I expect and what I want is that when I explain something for them, they need to fully understand it. But understanding to me means understanding just for the moment. When I explain something, I want it fully understood at that moment.
And, he added that if something is not fully understood at that moment, then the student needs to ask questions to make sure that it is fully understood.


"
Michel would teach the language by using explanations, examples and illustrations as the students were learning the grammar and the rules. This provided the initial mental exposure. He would then reinforce this through practice, which meant that he would have the student use the new know/edge in a variety of sentences. Michel would come back to the initial exposure and deepen the understanding until it became permanent. Understanding was demonstrated by the ability to apply the new know/edge in a variety of other circumstances. The concepts of understanding and know/edge were a critical component of Michel's method, and we shall discuss them more extensively later in this chapter.
Michel would continually monitor what the student was saying for anything that indicated a lack of understanding. When this happened, Michel would go back to what the student
already knew and would then refresh what was not understood.
At that point he would reinforce it with numerous examples until it was learned.

--(1)--Grammar
Tenses = "the tools of the language"
grammar = "the structure or mechanics of the language
"You learn the strokes of how to swim. Once you learn the structure, it becomes self-sufficient."

--(2)--Vocab 
the learner was taught a complete, practical and functional vocabulary.
sufficient vocabulary to enable the learner to begin to converse in the language
The students were encouraged to spend ten minutes a day reading the newspaper, magazines or interviews of interest to them
Continuing this process daily was very important in itself because it would build up vocabulary (The student would notice words that tend to reoccur and would then learn them)

With the initial audio course you will be comfortable swimming in a "deep pool or lake." As we have said, Michel would teach the students how to swim - how deeply they plunge and how fast they do so is up to them. After the five day course, there was no need for further instruction. The student learned how to swim and then he or she would swim. To use Michel's metaphor, 

"The style and speed of swimming come from practice"

--(3)-- Confidence 
The learner was given the confidence which came from *real* "swimming in the language" to use the language in actual conversations.

During the entire learning process, Michel would continue to reassure his students of their progress, which, in turn, boosted their self-esteem as well. Moreover, his students ended up carrying their confidence with them into other contexts of their personal and professional lives. Michel may have been arguably the best confidence builder around!

"Specific feedback derived from formative evaluation procedures - student's work assessed while in progress rather than at the end - stimulates the competence motive for all students."


--(4)--- Redundancy and creating the Aha Moment

When Michel would introduce a new concept, the tendency for many people was to try to grasp it and hold onto it. The reaction is like, "Oh, that is something new, and I have to remember it." The "have to" erases it and makes it difficult to come back to it. While the student is trying to remember it, he or she is stuck in the past. The very act of trying to hold on to it causes the student to lose it. Michel's point was to let it go because he would come back and reinforce it. It was not necessary to grasp it completely the first time because Michel deliberately built redundancy into his teaching and would reinforce a concept until it became natural. It may seem arbitrary the first time, but after several times it would become natural. So when Michel would make what he called an "initial imprint," it was important to leave it alone, not to hold onto it. If you left it alone, then it was there for you. In fact, Michel always would find it to be an interesting process to come back to it.

"It is the moment of what I call an imprint. The moment of understanding, of full understanding, is the moment of initial imprint. One doesn't try to hold onto it. I may at some point come back to it. They mayor may not remember when I come back to it. If they don't remember it immediately, I will reinforce it and they will say 'aha.' They will have the aha reaction, and they will have a deepening of the initial imprint. If they try to hold onto it, however, the imprint is gone.

One of two things will happen. Either the student will remember it and have the aha reaction or else the student may look for it and may not find it in which case that was fine according to Michel. He refined his explanation of imprints as follows:
So I will come back to it [the imprint] and it will be there again and I will deepen it. It is interesting to me that it works that way. If they remember it, they will have the aha reaction. The aha reaction means 'I am right there.' So I deepen it once and I may do it still another time. It will be there. Once I deepen it twice, it is there. It is also interesting to me because whenever one tries to remember, then it is gone.

---(5)--- Correction and Mistakes

 If the students made a mistake, Michel would never correct it. Instead he would "recycle" until the students thought it out and corrected it themselves. Michel would not directly correct his students and instead he would teach the students how to correct for themselves. 

 If you have to get annoyed, then get annoyed at me because I am doing it to you. You are not doing it to yourself. And I mean it. If you make a mistake, it is not your fault. It is up to me. If you miss something, if you want to get annoyed, it is perfectly alright. I accept it. Just get annoyed at me. Externalize your annoyance, but never get annoyed at yourself. It's like trying to drive a car while at the same time pushing on the accelerator and the brakes. It's not good for the car. It's not good for driving. You cannot do both at the same time.

 ---(6)---- Final Frames

 No homework - it is absolutely not allowed. No mentally reviewing what you have learned. "When we meet again, I don't expect you to remember anything."

 If something pops into your mind,  "Make no conscious effort to review. Just accept it. But it is important that you never go beyond it."





Gives spelling to help visualise

Spells key words like je voudrais

Preceding clause + Main SVO + Post clause


I'm sorry + that  + I cannot wait + because + I have to  + leave + now

I'm sorry + but  + I cannot come + with you + now  + because + I am + very busy















Going through the book to recall key points, maybe I was too harsh in my statement above that the book doesn't reveal "the secrets of" the method. I'll try to pull out those key points:

* No aversion to direct instruction. Cites the Project Follow-Through study results in support of direct instruction, and an old book by Ziggy Engelmann and Doug Carnine, called Theory of Instruction.

* Reference to Pareto's Law (the 80/20 principle) in relation to choosing what to teach and what to teach first.

* Focus on the teaching environment. (Make it nice, make it comfortable.)

* People remember well what they remember often. ("Rational analysis" focus on environment.)

* "Theory of optimal instruction": identify an optimal amount of information to teach pupils. (In Michel's case, then: high-frequency vocabulary and grammatical structures.)

* Responsibility for learning placed on teacher, not student.

* Learning without memorizing or forgetting: mix old and new -> "interleaved learning" (fewer items reviewed more often) + distributed practice and contextual diversity for generalisation

* Self correction

* Deciding what to teach (Ch. 9)
- Teach what is most useful
- Teach only one new skill at a time
- Teach easier skills before more difficult skills
- Separate similar skills (don't show them right next to each other at
first) and then teach concepts through minimal differences (positive
and negative examples)

* Norris Haring and Marie Eaton's "instructional hierarchy"
1. Acquisition
2. Fluency
3. Maintenance
4. Generalization
5. Application

Direct instruction AND constructivist approaches, but at different stages of learning

Michel's strategy for "teaching skills to accuracy":
1. Teach students to use a skill without any explanation
2. Provide an explanation, rationale, or rule for the use of the skill
3. Teach the skill further with more examples
4. Introduce exceptions to the rule
5. Teach exceptions through the principle of minimal differences
6. Show more negative examples

* Practice makes perfect / repetition rather than variety: ample opportunities IN CLASS for students to actively recall what they're learning

* Teach the principles that allow generalization

* Questions: don't try to teach new material just by asking questions (but Michel does ask questions, pretty much constantly, to which he has already taught the pieces needed for answering)

* Mnemonics: are good.

* Assessment: (normative), criterion-referenced, ipsative
- assessment-for-learning

* Praise and success: are good.

* Student errors: reflect on the teaching, not the learning.
- Strategies for correction:
1. Give the correction
2. Lead to correction by suggestive analogy / things known
3. "shaping" (accept imperfect but progressively better answers)

* Teach one thing at a time
* Make teaching explicit and open to only one interpretation
* Interleave learning and memorizing new vocabulary
* "Assess" throughout

* Questioning a class: ask, allow time for all to think, call on a student at random

* No homework

* Learning is fun!

=========

Complex rules that might thematically belong together (like verb conjugations) are broken apart so that each individual new form or word is learned on its own. Similar rules that might be confused are deliberately spread out.

=========

A major difference to most other approaches is that MT actively implements what Krashen calls “i+1”, where i is the current level of a learner, meaning that concepts are taught in the order of minimal effort. Each new step contains exactly one new rule. Most language courses group rules according to some underlying pattern, like tenses, and expect you to learn a whole group at once.

==========

 The particular mnemonic he used there was for the French faire: to make or to do. "It's a fair thing to do," he said.

 ===== 

Michel Thomas:
"Motivation is the product of one's innate drive for learning." One does not learn because one is motivated to do so. Motivation has merely become a catch word of the educational system. One may often hear a parent or teacher say to a child or student, "You have to be motivated!" That is their standard answer to everything, and as Michel always said, "It is their answer to bad teaching."

No one ever discusses the drive for learning, a situation which Michel considered to be almost criminal. This drive for learning is not some minor little drive. It is one of major importance that needs to be addressed. In this light, motivation is redundant. Motivation is innate and it goes together with the drive for learning. It is an innate by-product of the drive for
learning and is not something separate. Motivation is an integral part of the drive for learning

Observations from listening to Michel's French audio:

Speaks in English,

Continual method of asking questions, giving mini tests, part by part

X means Y
So how do you say AX?

J means K
So how do you say AXJ?

THe opposite of J 

Parske - put an S in the park
Qui - spelt q u i, who has the key?

Starts with an expression:
C'est la vie. You know this one.

-ible and -able

C'est - spells it - It is.
So how do you say, it is possible?

Adds another vocab word:
reinforces same pattern: C'est X, c'est Y

Good - bon
C'est bon
very good - tres bon

Comme ci, like this, comme ca, like that
Comme ca - that way, like that

It is like that... C'est comme ca
