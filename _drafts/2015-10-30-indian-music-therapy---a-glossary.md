<p>
There is a whole gamut of literature in Sanskrit which
helps us to understand the basic sounds which the vocal chords can produce, or
which will be used in a particular language. These texts help us first to become aware
of and decide which the basic sounds are, and then how to arrange these sounds to
form the alphabet. What shall be the organisation and the logical structure so that we
can be sure that all the basic sounds have been covered and nothing has been left
out?
