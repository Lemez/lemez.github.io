At Satya Special School, we have started an experimental music therapy laboratory, suported by Prof Nigel Osborne at the University of Edinburgh.

The school supports over 800 children, aged 1 to 18, with varying physical and mental conditions: microcephalitis, autism, cerebral palsy, Down's Syndrome and others.

The idea behind the project is simple: to explore various Indian traditions of sound, speech and the body in order to attempt to create a holistic methodology specifically designed for children with special needs. The team comprises expertise in the following areas:
- speech therapy
- psychophony
- yoga
- counselling psychology for children and adolescents
- singing and voice production
- Carnatic music (sacred South Indian classical music)
- general special needs education
- physiotherapy and hydrotherapy
- electronics and electro-acoustics
- konokol (verbal percussion)
- integral education (the educational philosophy of Sri Aurobindo and Mira Alfassa)
- neuroscience 
- sound healing
- ayurveda
- kalaripayattu (the animal imitation based martial art from Kerala)
- dance

What is exciting about the project is that there are plenty of overlaps between the areas of expertise, and the entire project is dedicated to finding out how and where they intertwine, and what we can learn from each other's practice.

Today I sat in on some 1 on 1 sessions with autistic children led by Judykael, the resident speech therapist. Many of these children are locked into silence, and their parents are desperate that their children seem totally uninterested in communicating verbally with them. Often they do not understand that their children prefer non-verbal communication - it was a revelation to see Judykael at work.

I have talked <a href="{{healing[0].url}}">before</a> about the impact that the healing framework of intent and receptivity has had on me - in fact, once you know it, it is difficult not to see all human communications through this lens.

Never is the truth of these two communication axioms more obvious than in watching a special needs professional.

Judy sits with autistic children on his lap, and works towards helping them to pronouce vowels and consonants. The way he does this is beautiful: first, he takes each child's name - Jo-Na-Than - and writes a small melody on his flute that reflects the vowel sounds, rhythm and changes in speaking pitch that occur in the child's name. 

Here is the astonishing bit: even if two children have names that have similar pitch, rhythmic and vowel patterns - for example Santhy and Shakti - *the children will only respond to the melody that was written expressly for them.*  

Santhy does not respond to Shakti's melody, and vice-versa. Whether this is because Judy's intent itself is purer when he uses a melody that he has written for an individual child, I don't know. But as we sit in the room, you can clearly see the communicative magic at work when 
- hugging, v physical communication
- kids want to touch him all the time
- he is v intimate, vibration on head on neck on back
- singing and touching physical vowels (natural speech method?)
- like mudras, hand movements for each articulation
- vibrator for the face to relax muscles - 
- if a child is smiling ALL the time, how can they pronounce anything?


- body listens - hearing with chest, side, back
get Ss to face front, back, side as they attempt to reproduce notes exactly
- you will see that they can, depending on how they stand












- game
pass sound (pitch) to each other, and receive in exact same way, then pass on new one
- game 2
two people sing a random note, and slowly go to meet each other
