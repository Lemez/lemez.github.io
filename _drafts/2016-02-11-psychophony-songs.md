At Satya Special School, we have started an experimental music therapy laboratory, suported by Prof Nigel Osborne at the University of Edinburgh.

The school supports over 800 children, aged 1 to 18, with varying physical and mental conditions: microcephalitis, autism, cerebral palsy, Down's Syndrome and others.

The idea behind the project is simple: to explore various Indian traditions of sound, speech and the body in order to attempt to create a holistic methodology specifically designed for children with special needs. The team comprises expertise in the following areas:
- speech therapy
- psychophony
- yoga
- counselling psychology for children and adolescents
- singing and voice production
- Carnatic music (sacred South Indian classical music)
- general special needs education
- physiotherapy and hydrotherapy
- electronics and electro-acoustics
- konokol (verbal percussion)
- integral education (the educational philosophy of Sri Aurobindo and Mira Alfassa)
- neuroscience 
- sound healing
- ayurveda
- kalaripayattu (the animal imitation based martial art from Kerala)
- dance

What is exciting about the project is that there are plenty of overlaps between the areas of expertise, and the entire project is dedicated to finding out how and where they intertwine, and what we can learn from each other's practice.

Today I sat in on some 1 on 1 sessions with autistic children led by Judykael, the resident speech therapist. Many of these children are locked into silence, and their parents are desperate that their children seem totally uninterested in communicating verbally with them. Often they do not understand that their children prefer non-verbal communication - it was a revelation to see Judykael at work.

He sits with autistic children on his lap, and works towards helping them to pronouce vowels and consonants. First, he takes each child's name - Jo-Na-Than - and writes a small melody on his flute that 

- hugging, v physical communication
- kids want to touch him all the time
- he is v intimate, vibration on head on neck on back
- singing and touching physical vowels (natural speech method?)
- like mudras, hand movements for each articulation
- vibrator for the face to relax muscles - 
- if a child is smiling ALL the time, how can they pronounce anything?


- body listens - hearing with chest, side, back
get Ss to face front, back, side as they attempt to reproduce notes exactly
- you will see that they can, depending on how they stand









Sayon - laugher


- game
pass sound (pitch) to each other, and receive in exact same way, then pass on new one
- game 2
two people sing a random note, and slowly go to meet each other
