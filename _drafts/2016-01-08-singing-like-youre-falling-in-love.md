I am six months into my carnatic music practice, and beginning to understand some of its power.

I will try to explain, but inevitably, words fail. 

Music is life, sound is life. Those two together with another - well, that is love. I do not know if I love her, but I know that I love what we do together, I love to do that thing with her.

I cannot now imagine wanting to do it with someone else, or anything else with her. We will just sing, and fall in love with ourselves and the world at the same time.

This love is a love for the world, for the possibility of emotion, for the excitement of control, for the beauty all around us. I feel that this love awakens in me an appetite for peace, perhaps if this is what it is to become a guru, then I am lucky. I know that I am lucky, lucky to have experienced this, to know what is this indescribable joy, this purity, this extremity of emotion. Yes I can say that it is love, and perhaps that if it is not life itself, then it is the key to life. It is an intensity of a moment that perhaps the gurus talk about. If enlightenment is a path, then this is certainly a step. 

I feel high and spaced out at the same time. The blood is flowing through my body, the energy id flowing, everything is sharp and real and intense and immediate.

I feel bathed in my own warm blood, at perfect peace and serenity. I am afriad that it will leave me soon - I knwo it will. But some 15-20 minutes after completing the session, it is still with me. Perhaps that is why I am writing, to seek to prolong it even further.

They say that meditation allows you to eperience the world in bliss. I dont know about meditation, but I can only say that this must be it. The integral yoga of the voice. I am energised deeply, yet the longer I get from the experience itself, the more it cools, subsides into somethng resembling fatigue. Perhaps it is this act of la petite mort, the spending of the enrgy that is causing this fatigue. As Sri Aurobindo wrote, to experience life in bliss is to nnow the artist's joy of inspiration, of perfection, and to be able to summon it at will, and then to experience it as a constant, every moment on earth blissful and perfect, every touch heavenly.

This is not glass half-full and half-empty stuff. This is glass overflowing, all the time. To know this state is to be eternally grateful. I know that if I distance myself from it, I will get frustrated with myself. Perhaps I will even begin to doubt its truth. But once you have expereinced this extreme, this truth, it is impossible to look at life again the same way.

Perhaps this is God. I certainly would not judge anyone who felt that they had found God whilst singing, deeply focussed on another's voice, trying to sing in perfect unison.

Yes, it was unison, perfect unison. It must be something of the thrill that singers in a choir feel. Except without consciously trying to sing anything, to remember notes. It was only a listening exercise.

As a listening exercise, what satisfaction it brings to be able to be in perfect sync with another.
Even now as I sing back out loud again the SA RE GA MA PA DA NI SA, it nrings with it a return of the bliss, the happiness. I am smiling from ear to ear now. I will have to stop writing for a bit to sing some more.

My ears are open to every sound, every richness of colour, every shade of light. Is this what dharma feels like? It is that same feeling returning from holiday in the sun to work. For two days, nothing can touch you. It is almost as itf the pupils are dilated to catch more light. You lvoe the world.

Yes, to be in love is to be attentive to another, to be in sync.

I am singing together with someone else. We sing together, nothing more than scales. We sing them slowly, attentive to each note, each movement, each exhalation. We focus inwards on our breath as we sing, and seek to sing exactly the same as the other, to anticipate their precise decision in advance, how will they attack the note, will it elide from one to another, where will an accent fall, which note will a glissando start from,
