L. 15: "North Wind" (Mao shi 41) is a song in the "Bei Airs" ("Bei feng" ifySM.) section of the Classic of Songs. The area of Bei, from which the Bei songs reputedly came, belonged to the Wei state. Thus, Xie Huilian designates "North Wind" as a "Wei Song."

L. 27: Man of the Ji 46 is Duke Mu U of Zhou. When people were crossing the Huangtai ϋ ϊ hills and heavy snow began to fall, Duke Mu composed a song in three stanzas to commiserate with the freezing people. The first line of each of the first two stanzas reads: "I have gone to Yellow Bamboo." See Mu Tianzi zhuan 5.4b. Yellow Bamboo (Huangzhu Jf fl·) presumably is another name for Huangtai.

 L. 34: What I have translated as "time of darkness" literally is "dark pitchpipes" (xuan Iu ~£W). In Chinese correlative thought each month corresponded to one of twelve pitches. Winter was the xuan (dark) season. Thus, Xie Huilian uses "dark pitchpipes" to designate the last month of winter.

Such success stories remain rare, as visual analysis of data still dominates the sciences. Yet vision has its limits. Many experiments measure a slew of variables at once, and the trick is to discover which of these are connected and how. As visual display technology has improved greatly it has been possible to display data in enhanced ways, but it is becoming a struggle. “Now we’re seeing people looking at very complicated graphs; they’re overloaded by data, and the visual system can’t handle it all,” says Matthew Schneps of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics.

Human hearing is extremely good at dealing with such noisy input. Making out what your interlocutor is saying at a crowded cocktail party, or noticing the approach of a predator among the cacophony of birds and bugs in a rainforest, can be done. “Where there are subtle changes of noise, or patterns in the change, that’s where the ear really takes over,” says Andy Hunt, of the University of York, in Britain.

Hearing presents a different set of strengths from that of vision. Humans can hear frequencies across three orders of magnitude, from about 20 to 20,000 hertz, and can discern tiny differences in those frequencies. They can deal with volumes from that of a pin dropping to a rock concert.

“If you want anyone to use your sonification, it shouldn’t sound too disturbing or give you a headache,” says Alexandra Supper, a sociologist at the University of Maastricht, in the Netherlands, “but at the same time there can also be a danger of making it sound too pleasing, such that it becomes background music.”

For sonification to become more widespread, researchers must bridge this divide. For Dr Worrall—a composer by training—the answer is in design, which he says “is an uncomfortable bedfellow” for both scientists and artists. But Paul Vickers of the University of Northumbria, in Britain, says progress is being made in breaking down scientists’ conservative nature and bringing in aesthetic elements in a serious and rigorous way. “We’re seeing people working in the scientific domains engaging with philosophers of music and psychologists, and thinking about how we listen in the real world to inform how we design sonifications.” Sounds promising.

 Perhaps hearing’s greatest strength is its temporal resolution, 100 times finer than that of vision: you will know if your favourite band’s drummer is as little as a few thousandths of a second late on the beat.

 But hearing can discern much more than just pitch and pace: it can pick up multiple instruments with differing timbres, keeping track of each note’s pitch, and even its attack and decay—how fast it rises and falls in volume.

 Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville invented sound recording when he conceived of a machine that would do for the ear what the camera did for the eye. His "phonautograph" inscribed airborne sounds onto paper, over time, to be studied visually. He called his recordings "phonautograms". Collections of his work lay silent and forgotten in venerable French institutions for 150 years—their provenance indisputable and their chain of custody uninterrupted. Following leads offered by First Sounds researcher Patrick Feaster and tips gleaned on the trail, David Giovannoni located six collections containing several dozen sound recordings made in Paris between c.1853 and 1860. Neither Scott de Martinville nor his contemporaries conceived of playing back his recordings; however, First Sounds—Patrick Feaster in particular—has coaxed nearly 20 to speak and sing to date.

The First Phonautograph

Scott de Martinville first imagined an apparatus to gather and fix airborne sounds, patterned after the human ear, while editing Professor Longet’s Traité de Physiologie. In 1853 or 1854 (he cites both years) he began work on “le problème de la parole s'écrivant elle-même” [“the problem of speech writing itself”]. By the end of 1857, with support from the Société d’encouragement pour l’industrie nationale, his phonautograph was recording sounds with sufficient precision to be adopted by the scientific community. As a laboratory instrument it contributed for decades to the nascent science of acoustics.

His vision was as much aesthetic as scientific, and he was captivated by his invention's power to register the ephemeral onto paper: “Pourra-t-on conserver à la génération future quelques traits de la diction d’un de ces acteurs éminents, éminents, de ces grands artistes qui meurent sans laisser après eux la plus faible trace de leur génie?”
