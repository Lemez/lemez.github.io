In the Natya Shastra, the world's first treatise on the performing arts, are detailed the nine universal primary emotions of man.

Sringara - creation

Sringara is the highest of all rasa: it is creation, the birth of the new, the continuation of humanity. Without sringara, there is no universe.

Sringara is any experience that causes you to create, including: 
- physical attraction, love, sex 
- being in the flow of productive work
- artistic inspiration, as you come up with new ideas
- conversations with people that cause new ideas to flower
- any inspired piece of on-the-spot creativity

It is not contentedness, fat cat on the sofa happiness. It is not wellbeing, and balance, and all of those things that are sometimes said to be an ultimate goal. It is the feeling of magic, that you are growing, that the world is changing around you, and you are the force behind it.

This is what I seek - sringara.
