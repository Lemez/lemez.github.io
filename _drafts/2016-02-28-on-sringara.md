Today's post is a linguistic one, about the word *sringara*. That may not mean much to you now, but hopefully I can explain why this word is what I - and perhaps you - have been seeking for a long, long time.

If you look it up in a Sanskrit dictionary, most likely you'll see the translation "love". But like most direct translations, especially from Sanskrit, the concept touches on love while going far beyond. The idea of sringara is less *love*, and more everything that inspires that feeling.

A bit of history: there exists in India a *sastra* - a manuscript - on the performing arts, called the Natya Sastra. It is the world's first comprehensive treatise on the performing arts, and it explains a system of nine emotions, known as *rasas*, which still define the classical arts in India. 

A *rasa*, poorly translated again as "taste" or "emotion" according to our useless Sanskrit dictionary, is actually the defining emotional onject of a play or performance. What is it that a performer wants the audience to feel? What emotional flavour does the performer want the audience to savour?

The selected rasa then becomes an unseen director for the piece, guiding the set, the scenery, the dialogues. If the chosen rasa for the performance is *sringara*, then should the balcony in the scene have flowers on it? Presumably so. And if so, what flowers? 

Sringara is the Bollywood framework par excellence. When the boy and girl cavort in the meadow, how is it that the audience do not get bored, thinking "we've seen this before"? Of course they have, but that is the beauty of sringara - the job of a piece of entertainment is to lead us to an emotional state that we already know.

But sringara is much more than just romantic love. According to Tantric mystical practice, sringara is every state in which something new is created. Think about that for a moment: of course, romantic love - in the best or worst instances, depending on how you look at it - leads to the creation of new life. It certainly leads to the creation of new energy and desire, no matter what results. But sringara is also the state of inspiration, which Csikentmihaly calls 'flow'. Sringara is that creative state of making something out of nothing, which every artist knows and tries desperately to recreate each day. Sringara is the state in which new ideas flow out of you effortlessly: sringara is quite simply being 'in the zone'.

In Tantra, sringara is not just another emotion, but the heighest of all human states. And so, anything that can lead to sringara - meditation, art, physical practice, meaningful interaction with another person - has equal value as spiritual practice. Some people prefer to pray, others to sing or dance or write - whatever it is that you do, as long as it leads you to sringara, you are on the right path.

Sringara is not content, cat on the sofa happiness. It is not wellbeing, and balance, and all of those things that are sometimes said to be an ultimate goal. It is the feeling of magic, that you are growing as an individual, that the world is changing around you, and you are the force behind it.

This is what I seek - sringara.

Sringara - creation

Sringara is the highest of all rasa: it is creation, the birth of the new, the continuation of humanity. Without sringara, there is no universe.

Sringara is any experience that causes you to create, including: 
- physical attraction, love, sex 
- being in the flow of productive work
- artistic inspiration, as you come up with new ideas
- conversations with people that cause new ideas to flower
- any inspired piece of on-the-spot creativity

There are nine emotions - sringara is the greatest of these.
Positivity, anger, love - how can we understand these emotions? Are they even emotions?
Howe backwards Western psychology now seems.

What is masturbation - empty sringara. Nothing is created. Does it move you, inspire you, excite you? That is sringara.

mantra = breath + sound (sabda)
Sabda - using letters or syllables

16 vowels are Shiva
36 consonants are Shakti (K, G etc)
K + A = KA (or any combination) = Shiva and Shakti

Both K and A have no meaning- together they have meaning

AK (last letter?) is the start of creation, when Shiva started creating the universe

Triangle = inital power of the universe

(panini sutras)
A + A- = I-
I + I- = U-

Shabda sparsa ruba rasa

Bindu is promordial enery of the cosmos, From there expansion happened and the sounds were born (U-)

Sound is divided into 4, all audible:
1- para = ultimate sound. One syllable. It is SA. Para bija = SA
This is used as the ultimate mantra -> Sauh. You become Shiva you can feel the universe.
2- madhyama
3- pashanti - the pause in between two words, the place where music starts, muladhara kundalini. There is a vibration between two packets of energy. Manodharma starts here. Osho has written a book about this. Buddhist tantras have no God - Indian tantras depend on Siva and Santra
4- vayikheri - you can see the 



- vizarga - last word. Three bindus.

AH. - ends in Shiva

Lakshmi, Kali, Saraswati = 3 sides of triangle

Siva + shakti - the way to get to mukti

you mind unites with your atma (Shakti, inner soul) to create ultimate energy (Siva) - this leads to Mukti, universal power

You MUST enjoy practice - mantra, singing, whatever. It all comes from there. You must not have fear.

5 elements, chakras as elements
Muladhara = earth
Swadisthana = fire
Manguram = water
Vayu = agas
anahatam

Initiaton (Sakti pardh) = giving of energy from one man to another man.
From one Siva (a man who is in state of mukti) to another.
If you meditate daily, only then you can understand thi philosophy. Read the books after the initiation. What we do is secret - v secret place where you are not to be disturbed.

If someone comes in they may misunderstand, just like in art. They destroy the totality of your work.
We chant secretly, even we should not move our lips, we chant inside. Iside is Siva, outside is Shakti.

Manas + Atma

if a man with mukti dies, he is put in samadhi. he is siva. he is the universe.
otherwise he is nothing. if you go to samadhi at midnight, you will hear the breath, the prana of a dead guru, chanting the mantra of hamsa

you live through breath, not food

hamsaman... ham sa soo ham... shakti and siva mantra

mantra practice: initially you get sparks, then they become fire, then you are totally in the spirit of the nectar, almost alcohol
you will be in it fully , totally

A man who talks has not seen, a man who has seen does not talk.

DO not dwell on the theory - do the practise

you shd be under a guru - a guru should taste you and know what food to give you
guru knows who needs what, what is good for each person

guru shd realise the disciple - give them what they need, not more not less
take from the guru with love and passion
