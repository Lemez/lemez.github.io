In the Natya Shastra, the world's first treatise on the performing arts, are detailed the nine universal primary emotions of man.

Sringara - creation

Sringara is the highest of all rasa: it is creation, the birth of the new, the continuation of humanity. Without sringara, there is no universe.

Sringara is any experience that causes you to create, including: 
- physical attraction, love, sex 
- being in the flow of productive work
- artistic inspiration, as you come up with new ideas
- conversations with people that cause new ideas to flower
- any inspired piece of on-the-spot creativity

It is not contentedness, fat cat on the sofa happiness. It is not wellbeing, and balance, and all of those things that are sometimes said to be an ultimate goal. It is the feeling of magic, that you are growing, that the world is changing around you, and you are the force behind it.

This is what I seek - sringara.

My studio partner Yaniv

There are nine emotions - sringara is the greatest of these.
Positivity, anger, love - how can we understand these emotions? Are they even emotions?
Howe backwards Western psychology now seems.

What is masturbation - empty sringara. Nothing is created. Does it move you, inspire you, excite you? That is sringara.

mantra = breath + sound (sabda)
Sabda - using letters or syllables

16 vowels are Shiva
36 consonants are Shakti (K, G etc)
K + A = KA (or any combination) = Shiva and Shakti

Both K and A have no meaning- together they have meaning

AK (last letter?) is the start of creation, when Shiva started creating the universe

Triangle = inital power of the universe

(panini sutras)
A + A- = I-
I + I- = U-

Shabda sparsa ruba rasa

Bindu is promordial enery of the cosmos, From there expansion happened and the sounds were born (U-)

Sound is divided into 4, all audible:
1- para = ultimate sound. One syllable. It is SA. Para bija = SA
This is used as the ultimate mantra -> Sauh. You become Shiva you can feel the universe.
2- madhyama
3- pashanti - the pause in between two words, the place where music starts, muladhara kundalini. There is a vibration between two packets of energy. Manodharma starts here. Osho has written a book about this. Buddhist tantras have no God - Indian tantras depend on Siva and Santra
4- vayikheri - you can see the 



- vizarga - last word. Three bindus.

AH. - ends in Shiva

Lakshmi, Kali, Saraswati = 3 sides of triangle

Siva + shakti - the way to get to mukti

you mind unites with your atma (Shakti, inner soul) to create ultimate energy (Siva) - this leads to Mukti, universal power

You MUST enjoy practice - mantra, singing, whatever. It all comes from there. You must not have fear.

5 elements, chakras as elements
Muladhara = earth
Swadisthana = fire
Manguram = water
Vayu = agas
anahatam

Initiaton (Sakti pardh) = giving of energy from one man to another man.
From one Siva (a man who is in state of mukti) to another.
If you meditate daily, only then you can understand thi philosophy. Read the books after the initiation. What we do is secret - v secret place where you are not to be disturbed.

If someone comes in they may misunderstand, just like in art. They destroy the totality of your work.
We chant secretly, even we should not move our lips, we chant inside. Iside is Siva, outside is Shakti.

Manas + Atma

if a man with mukti dies, he is put in samadhi. he is siva. he is the universe.
otherwise he is nothing. if you go to samadhi at midnight, you will hear the breath, the prana of a dead guru, chanting the mantra of hamsa

you live through breath, not food

hamsaman... ham sa soo ham... shakti and siva mantra

mantra practice: initially you get sparks, then they become fire, then you are totally in the spirit of the nectar, almost alcohol
you will be in it fully , totally

A man who talks has not seen, a man who has seen does not talk.

DO not dwell on the theory - do the practise

you shd be under a guru - a guru should taste you and know what food to give you
guru knows who needs what, what is good for each person

guru shd realise the disciple - give them what they need, not more not less
take from the guru with love and passion
