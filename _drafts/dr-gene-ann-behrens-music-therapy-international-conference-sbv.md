Ruud (1980) good book on pyschological perspectives in MT.
One practice is CBT - helping ppl explore thoughts and feelings

Recently developed MT Trauma Informed Framework, based on neurobiology of trauma research.
Trauma (PTSD) rates increasing; high rates of correlation btw trauma and comorbidity.

"It all begins with Freud" - really ? 1886
Trauma as widely accepted social condition that can affect anyone is recent.

CBT - the most researched method around in psychology, esp for anxiety, anger control, stress, bulimia

2001 - v few refs to CBT in MT literature;
2007, 2015 studies - still few refs to "" "" "" "";

Neurobiology of trauma research (2000 - to present day)
Trauma - neurobiological change in brain:
- less left-hemisphere activity (Brocchus) - ppl say 'it's hard to talk about it'
- lack of mediation form orbitofrontal cortex reduces ability to regulate emotions and relationships
- limited integration in hippocampus inhibits ability to connect and recall events; fragmented memories

New best practices - revolutionary in PTSD treatment:
- talking too early can retraumatize clients and cause harm
- need to focus on positively changing the brain 
- unlearn reactive patterns and learn adaptive coping
- focus on body-oriented, sensory, non-verbal approach before moving to verbal

Limited research on these new best practices
1) Sensory and Body
2) Positive changes to brain (Focus on Beauty)
3) Talk about it and learn adaptive coping

Get the sequence right - safety and trust.

See Ziegler 2011.

Neuroscience is v informative here:
Music is proceessed througout the brain - what gets fired together, gets wired together
(Schlaug 2009, Sergent 1993)
- Musicians brain is different than non musicians brain 
- integrated left right hemisphere movement

Principles
1) need individualised assessment of trauma, without retraumatizing, music therapy must be based on individual needs
2) goal oriented outcomes - neural goals
3) Structured ritual predictability - music provides time-ordered, safe rituals
4) Establish therapeutic relationship - music provides inter & intra personal relationships
5&6) Provide education to help clients self-regulate, control reactive, use adaptive strategies
- music can provide this
7) Work in the moment - music provides that.
8) Supportive collaborative world: they need external support, they cannot evaluate. MT allows ability-ordered, successful experiences in v small steps
