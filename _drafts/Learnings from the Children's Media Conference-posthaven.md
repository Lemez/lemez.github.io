Learnings from the Children's Media Conference

The Children's Media Conference in Sheffield last week was unforgettable -  a warm community of people who both love the same things I do and are aware of intrinsic potential problems: stuff for kids that talks up to them, not down; technology with its opportunities and dangers; the ethics of stickiness for kids in the first place.

Here are some key insights I took away from the panel sessions:

Content: Children want to see themselves reflected on screen. Don't shy away from including fears, silliness and (my personal favourite) absurdity. (Alice Webb, BBC)

Audience: Don't worry about how often you upload new content to a blog or Youtube - just make sure that it is ready. (Michael Stevens, VSauce)

Licensing: It can work in two ways - you can license other people's content (an expensive headache), or they can license your technology (an expensive holiday). Be smart! (Kelvyn Gardner, Lima)

Interactivity: BBC is the major commissioner of children's content, and they are about to become a lot more education-focussed in all their digital offerings. Interactive video is coming big time to the BBC, and personalisation will be at the heart of kids content as they roll out the ambitious MyBBC project. (Sinead Rocks, BBC Learning)

Funding: Talk to NESTA and the Wellcome Trust, as well as traditional investors, who, in the words of one of them, "I invest in you to get as much equity as I can so that I can own a grouse moor". (Iain Dodgeon, Wellcome)

Ideas: No matter how new an idea is, pitch it fearlessly.  Puppy & Zebra - we're looking at you! 

Publishing: "We read everything that lands on our desk. So send it in!" (Claire Wilson, Rogers, Coleridge and White Literary Agency)
And my overall learnings over the course of the festival:

Relationships: The commissioners say the same thing - being easy to get along with is the key criterion when working out who they should commission (note to self to reply to emails quicker).
Big & small: People in big companies are much more accessible and friendly than you think. Don't assume that just because you are a minnow, they won't engage with you. In my experience at CMC, it's just the opposite: you have the agility and freedom to execute ideas that they crave.
