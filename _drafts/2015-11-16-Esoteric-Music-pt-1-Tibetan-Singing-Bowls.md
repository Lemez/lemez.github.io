<h3>My Introduction</h3>

During my time in India, I am being initiated slowly into esoteric music practices.

It started with my morning vocal workshops with the Adishakti actors, and in particular Nimmy Raphael. My singing and music theory classes with her soon turned into an exploration of the limits of her voice, and the extraordinary sounds she can make at the very edge of vocalization. There was something of Meredith Monk <a href="{{nimmy.url}}">in her voice</a>, spanning 3 - 4 octaves, capable of great expressive power.

In our sessions we talked a great deal about esoteric and spiritual voice traditions. Her guru and the founder of Adishakti, Veenapani Chawla, had brought Tibetan monks from their exiled enclave in Karnataka to train the actors in their ritual practice. 

They had learnt Kathakali padam singing, the stylized Sanskrit chanting that accompanies Kathakali theatre, with its swinging head movements that reminded me so much of ultra-Orthodox Jews <em>davening</em> at the Wailing Wall. 

They studied the ancient Indian treatise on the arts and breathing, the Natyashatra, and built on its theory of rasas - the evocation of the nine core emotions through breathing patterns.

They studied Sanskrit shlokas from the Rig Veda, the incantations at the heart of Hindu spiritual tradition, from Dr Sampad Mishra, with whom I am lucky enough to be getting my own Sanskrit lessons.
