Parkison's Patients - Improving Daily Lives and Locomotion

Neurologic Music Therapy (NMT) as a model / approach
- Developed in 1990s in Colorado State Uni
- music impact on functional changes of brain
- focussed on non musical goals
- patient-focussed, individual needs, direct functional targets

- Measuring blood pressure, pulse etc to see physical changes
- Measure neuro and muscle plasticity, relation btw emotion, music and movement to enhance -plasticity: music is best way to increase plasticity
- music for cognitive functions
- music and rhythm (esp. Anna's work with Parkinson's)
- principles of motor learning, movement abilities ... using simple instruments , eg drum, and get patient to play while doing specific movements, super goal oriented

See Ana's diagram of music and the brain


See Ana's lists of techniques for all three of the below

Three groups of techniques:
- sensorimotor
	- Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) - audio cues for motor processes etc
	- Pattern Sensory Enhancement (PSE) - enhance movements associated with daily life (not necessarily rhythmic), uses pitch, dynamics, harmony etc
	- Therapeutic Instrumental Music Performance (TIMP) - uses percussion, coordination, dexterity, v good for functional goals
- cognitive
- speech language
		- Melodic Intonation Therapy
		- Music Speech Stimulation Vocal Intonation Therapy
		- Rhythmic Speech Cueing
		- Therapeutic Singing
		- Developmental Speech and Language Training through Music
		- Symbiotic Communication training through Music
		- Oral Motor and Respiratory Exercises

Transformational Design Model 
1) diagnostic assessment of patient
2) treatment goals and measurements agreed
3) appropriate exercises selected, without musical elements
4) use musical elements
5) transfer functional activities to daily life without music

Ana's sessions
16 sessions over 4 weeks of 45 mins, individuals, percussion as basis, to see if NMT Sensorimotor techniques improve locomotion of patient with parkinsons

1) warmup
2) daily activities
3) pre gait training
4) stimuation of particular groups of muscles, part of the gait pattern
5) breathing
