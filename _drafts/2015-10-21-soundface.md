For three months I worked with Nimmy Raphael, lead actor at Adishakti Theatre in Auroville, South India, on an exploration of the limits of an actor's voice.

She amazed me with the sounds she could produce, like feedback from electric guitar distortion, using only her voice.

We decided to film these explorations as a work in progress.

Video coming soon.
