Learning Tamil in A Week - Why I Believe It Is Possible
This is an experiment in language learning.

I'm in Tamil Nadu, India, for a week.  While I'm here, I'm going to try to learn to speak Tamil - by that, I mean being able to have a conversation with people I meet about whatever I want. 

A few words about what I'll do and why:

- I want to be able to speak and understand - I won't learn to read and write the Tamil alphabet for now. As beautiful as the Tamil script is, reading and writing is a more indirect form of communication, and therefore less immediate, more reflective. It requires a different type of mental approach, one that would be wasted while I am here, surrounded by real people I hope to be able to communicate with directly.

- I will have fun. That means using the language to do the things I usually enjoy: talking to people, joking around, singing.

- I will make mistakes, as many as possible.

 For the last three years, as part of my language learning startup Tonguesten, I have been thinking intensely about how we acquire languages, and how that process can be made easier. 

I believe that:

1) all languages are easy to learn - so easy that even a small child can learn them perfectly

2) if you can speak one language well, you can learn any other with little effort

3) as we get older, learning a new language gets easier, not harder

4) the key to success is to enjoy yourself and let go of your fears

These are controversial beliefs. Countless scientific journals and the minds of many brilliant people suggest that I am wrong. If you want to disagree with me, feel free to do so . But if your interest in piqued, then allow me to go into more detail about each of the points above:

1) Languages are tools created by human beings to enable us to communicate with each other. They are not perfect tools -  no matter what language you speak, you can end up arguing with someone over a simple misunderstanding - but as communication tools go, they are the best we've got. There is no such thing as a 'hard language' to learn. 

4) The easiest way to enjoy yourself is to talk to people.  Start with speaking, not reading or writing. The early stages of learning to read and write 





 Linguists and neuroscientists would have us believe that when we are children our brains are more plastic, adaptable, and able to absorb new things. I believe something else: 

adults can learn a new language just as easily as children, as long as we lose our sense of fear


a world of Google Translate, where everything can be translated into your mother tongue, means that you miss out on all the beauty that each culture has to offer
