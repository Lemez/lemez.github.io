Alfred Tomatis is considered one of the key figures in the field of psycho-acoustics: the relationship between the mind, hearing and health.

Following service in the war, Tomatis started a research lab investigating 'occupational deafness' with soldiers who had been overexposed to loud noise in battle. He had a hard time recruiting them for tests, as it was believed that a poor score on his tests would get them fired. At great expense he bought an audiometre from the USA to measure hearing levels accurately, and set about pleading and cajoling his subjects into allowing him to measure their hearing. 

Some months later he presented his findings at an international ENT conference on occupational deafness, the first of its kind. This groundbreaking conference led to wide public recognition, and as a result, Tomatis was inundated with requests from ex-servicemen for testing. They now believed that to have a recognised disability would be an asset. To Tomatis's astonishment, the results were now exactly the opposite of the results before the conference. Suspecting the soldiers of cheating, he tried all sorts of tricks to get them to reveal their actual hearing level, rather than, as he believed, pretending not to hear well when actually they could. After extensive head-scratching, he came to realise that their poor peformance on the hearing test now <em>was not conscious</em>: rather, in the previous tests, they had wanted to hear well, and so had actually heard better than they did now.
