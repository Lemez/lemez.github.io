On Motivation, User Experience and the Language of Business
"Once a task involves even rudimentary cognitive skill, the larger the reward, the poorer the performance." Dan Ariely, Gneezy et al
I am reading two fascinating books at the moment: Daniel Pink's "Drive" and Paolo Freire's "The Pedagogy Of The Oppressed". One is an examination of what motivates us as human beings and how we can use this understanding to build better working environments; the second is a political manifesto of what education should look like in the 21st century. Pink summarises his ideas in this TED talk - he's a bit shouty, but it's a quick way to see his core insights.</br>

We are at a very interesting stage in our young education startup, Tonguesten. We are growing and changing in lots of ways. We are building the team, adding more core skills to our small group of dreamers. We've worked hard to date on building our artificial intelligence system, now we are working on finding the very best way to present that to students in our apps. And for that, we need UX.</br>

The hippest folk in technology these days are 'UX' or 'User Experience' designers. They charge a hefty rate for helping companies to understand how people will use their app, and how to create a meaningful experience that keeps people coming back. My good friend, designer Adrian Philpott, is a graphical wizard, but in the early days of our company he told me that he could not design any interface without having a UX designer by his side. We hired a very well-regarded designer to work alongside him, but a few thousand pounds lighter, we realise that our user experience is not yet right, and we need to take a good hard look at what exactly user experience in education means. How do we apply badges, scoring, rewards to our system? Which of the myriad successful education companies can be a role model - DuoLingo, Busuu, Babbel - if any of them? To understand user experience, we need to understand what motivates our users, and for that, we need to look hard at what exactly we are asking our users to do.</br>

This is where Daniel Pink comes in. He talks of two types of motivation - intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation is our natural interest, our innate desire to explore, master and create - just for the sheer joy of the thing itself.It is the motivator of autonomy, mastery and purpose. Extrinsic motivators are the sticks and carrots - bonuses, rewards and badges that act as a quick dopamine rush. Study after study has shown that the more routine and less inherently enjoyable a task is, the more useful extrinsic motivators like money can be. If you want people to stuff envelopes quickly, giving bonuses to the ones with the highest output works pretty well. But - and here's the rub - if people are engaged in activities which require creativity and create a natural feeling of pleasure - then bonuses can have <em>exactly the opposite effect.</em> So our first critical job is to understand what we are asking our users to do.</br>

Does the task have a clear set of rules? If so, incentives will narrow our focus and help each user to do it better.

Or is the task more creative and asking users to come up with answers that lie on the periphery of what they can see? If so, incentives will backfire.

And so, back to our user experience.

The key motivators that Pink identifies are intrinsic. How can we make our users experience autonomy, mastery and purpose?

Get the issue of money off the table.




Within UX itself, the buzz-word is 'gamification' - how to make routine tasks more like a game, and therefore more enjoyable for the participants. The problem is that all games are not the same - and our challenge is to create a gaming environment that motivates students as much as possible. So before we talk about gamification, </br>





First, let's look at motivation. Pink's great insight is that motivation is inherently related to the nature of the task at hand.
