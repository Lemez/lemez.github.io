Thoughts about MT and autism.

- group session / individual:

1) ritual physical / sonic to signal beginning: sing Hello song to each child 
2) relaxation - calm
	mother hugs child and sings low OOOO (SA) - child hand on chest
	mother hugs child and sings medium AAAA (PA) - child hand on throat
	mother hugs child and sings high MMMM (SA) - child hand on head

	Sing Tamil lullabye together

3) exercises
4) ritual physical / sonic to signal end: sing Bye Bye song to each child  

ex idea:

use 5/6 cups to represent different notes (pentatonic, C D E G A C)
- start with one cup. When you touch it, it makes a sound (through your voice)
- add another cup: show that both make sounds
- add 3rd, 4th, 5th: make melodies

Show kids the patterns of different cups: repeated melodies accompanied by actions with cups

Get them to sing, and to compose one by one a new song?

Music, and music therapy can encompass so many things, from children with stress and trauma, to physical relief and relaxation, to encouraging dance and movement and participation. 

Music therapy can be receptive, like in sound healing where the recipient lies down and does nothing except enjoy the vibratory bath around them: it can be participatory, where you are not therapist and recipient, but partners in a dialogue.

Judykael has a beautiful framework for understanding his work: participatory pleasure. That is, it must be pleasurable for the child and pleasurable for him: if neither of those two exist, he says, the session will not work.

I have understood that for any session to be deemed a success, you need to have a clear goal - otherwise, it will not be pleasurable for you, the beginning therapist.

It seems that the autism group need my help, and I will be working a lot with them. It seems that for these children, using their voice to communicate is a major goal of the school, both of Judykael's work and the work of other staff. So, it seems to me that voice work with the children can be an excellent focus: if I can get them to sing, to physically feel their voice, then perhaps they will be able to speak.


There is a group at Satya school which is very difficult for the teachers to handle - a class of teenage autistic boys who can be agitated, aggressive, frustrated. Of course, it is not their fault - the first rule of working with autistic children is that they value constancy, steadiness, reliable routines above all other things. For reasons that are not entirely clear, their group has recently been split, the furniture removed, the classroom changed. And so the children have reacted with dismay and anger, which they communicate daily, sometimes physically, to the teachers. One small-built female teacher is in charge of this group of frustrated, physically imposing teenage boys, and she needs help.

Before deciding on what to do, it is worth asking: what are the things that music can do?

It seems that there are two ways in which music can affect us. 

The first way is cognitively: a piece of music - or any sound for that matter - can remind us of something, a memory, with which we will have associations. These associations can be good or bad - something which you cannot know without observing each individual. But music will always have some kind of cognitive reaction - that we like or don't like it, how it makes us feel emotionally etc.

The second way is physically: the vibrations in the sound waves themselves affect our bodies without any conscious processing at all. I have already written about how the whole body is an ear - and the ear is the sense that develops before all others. Sounds travel into our brain in two ways: through the air to our ear drums, which transmit electrical messages to our brain, and through our body. Our skeleton is extremely good at moving sound throughout the body: each bone is like a string, passing on vibrations from one to the other with extreme effectiveness. It's worth remembering here that water - the primary component of our bodies - is one of the best conductors of energy that we know of.

To see what I mean, you can try this little experiment: hold your arms out straight in front of you, and sing a low 'ee' note. Try to hold the same note for 5-10 seconds. You will feel your fingers vibrating. Try moving your hands above your head to see if the feeling changes. Try sitting, crouching or lying down: what can you feel vibrating now?

When we speak or sing, the sound rings through our whole skeleton. The same is true for sounds that we receive from the outside world: our whole body transmits them, they pass through our bones and our organs back up to our brain.

This morning, I watched a yoga session for a young group of autistic children.
Simple, short exercises. Mums are very happy.
