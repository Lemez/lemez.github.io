I have started working at school for special needs in Pondicherry. For the first time in my life, I am spending time with autistic children. Prior to this, my only knowledge about autism was Dustin Hoffman's character in RainMan, a cheesy 90s film with Tom Cruise. You may remember that Hoffman's character had a brilliant mind, was an awkward communicator, and was obsessed with certain objects.

There is more than a whiff of reality in the Hollywood portrayal. Autistic children can get obsessed with toys or ordinary objects - and with smartphones and tablets in particular. They can have violent tantrums if you try to take the device away. Sometimes parents give them a device just to get some time off. As the father of a three year-old, this is all too familiar territory - who out there does not use Youtube as a babysitter when we just want a few quiet minutes? 

It is not just children, autistic or otherwise, who find it impossible to put their devices away. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8436831/Student-addiction-to-technology-similar-to-drug-cravings-study-finds.html">Device withdrawal</a> is described as 
being similar to drug addiction, with cravings leading to physical pain and worse.

What is it about consumer technology that seems to be sucking up ever more of our time? It may come as no surprise to learn that this is not by accident, but by design.

But to understand how device addiction is actually *a integral part of their design*, it helps to understand how the technology industry itself works. All the examples I use here are taken from my personal experience running a startup in one of London's most prestigious accelerator, WAYRA, owned by telecoms behemoth Telefonica.

While IPO offerings for Facebook and Twitter might take up more headlines, this is the 1% of startups who actually get to be listed on the stock market, and opening up their shares for public trading. For everyone else, there are institutional private equity investors, known in the business as venture capitalists, or VCs.

<a href="http://thebusinessprofessor.com/venture-capital-method/">Venture capital</a> is high-risk capital by nature - nine out of ten startups do not make it past their third year. In order for a VC firm to invest in your business, companies need to show ten, twenty or thirty times growth in as little as two years. To be clear - you need to show how your company will become turbo-charged on steroids the minute their investment hits your bank account if you want to stand a chance of getting investment. As so many of their investments will fail, the VCs argue, the bar must be set high enough that even if only one out of twenty succeeds, it will be worth their while. Companies that desire sustainable growth, growing slowly but steadily based on increasing revenues need not apply.

Therefore at the heart of almost every technology startup that receives investment is, by definition, an unsustainable business model. Startups are pressured to think in terms of 





It reminds me a lot of my time working in the <a href="{{tech[0].url}}">consumer software</a>.

The road into programming taught me a lot about both the way computers work, and that way that the technology industry thinks and influences discourse. 

This quote above from Steve Jobs is typical of the claptrap you can hear every day from government ministers downwards. Digital technology is heralded as the great answer for our times, and anyone in disagreement is a Luddite to be shamed in public, or ignored as resistant to change.

To be clear, I am a fan of technology, but only in sufficient context. 

Steve "Jesus" Jobs forgot to add one thing in his legendary quote above about computers - by all means learn to programme, but this becomes your dominant way of thinking, then you are screwed for life.

Computers are not magic. They are dumb machines, not smart. They use binary logic, and every decision is made from a series of yes/no decision trees. A programmer must anticipate every yes and no on this tree in order for the programme to work. If he or she doesn't, the computer programme will break, and the device will crash.

Throughout history, there have been three types of trillion dollar plus company: 
1) companies that relied on slavery, monopoly of trade routes and theft of natural resources (Dutch East India Company, the Mississippi Company, the South Sea Company)
2) companies that exploited natural resources in monopolies (Saudi Aramco, Exxon)
3) companies that sold consumer products in near-monopoly conditions (IBM, Microsoft). 

To that list, going back five hundred years, we can add a new type:
4) companies that give their products to us consumers for free (Alphabet/Google etc).

To every happy user of free digital products, the question must be - if I'm not paying money to these companies for my service, how they hell are they worth a trillion-odd dollars? And if I'm not paying in money terms, then how am I paying exactly?

<h3>From Numbers to Autism</h3>

To understand how you pay, first you need to understand what consumer technology companies care about more than anything else - what they stress about in meetings, what drives their internal targets, what replaces real money as the yardstick by which investors decide whether or not to risk their pile. 

<h4>Metrics</h4> 

Behind that innocent word is an entire sub-industry dedicated to tracking your every digital movement: how often you click, where you click, what colours you like to click on, what your clicking pattern says about you, and so on. The most important part of the entire tracking procedure is
