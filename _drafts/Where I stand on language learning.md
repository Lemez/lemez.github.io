Where I stand on language learning

If I have to put a label on it, I guess I am of the social interactionist school, as promoted by Vygotsky and others: 
learning language is a step-by-step loop, with three key areas:
- fun -> feedback -> reinforcement
all within the zone of proximal development ( a task that is just within reach)

Two aspects are important here:
- what it is, and a method of learning it most optimally
- who we think we are, and how we react to US doing this thing

Human beings learn things. We've all learnt at least one language before. It is therefore something that everyone in the whole world can do without much effort.

Hm, but the last time we did it, we were young children, and it is easier for them, isn't it.

How to speak starts with listening: you must know what sounds you have to choose from. This has a few steps:
- common sounds
- sounds that you don't have in your language
- which sounds might get confused and mean different things

To learn requires presence. When you come across a new word, you must get to know it, to taste it in your mouth, to feel it, to understand it. What flavour does it have? What association does it create in your mind? How will we link it to something you already know?

We recall by creating imprints: conscious or unconscious.

- associations, mnemonics (conscious)
- musical, rhythmic (conscious / un-)
- just understanding aka the AHA moment (unconscious) 

To recall it is important that we do not try to remember, for some reason, that erases the strength of the imprint (MT).

Nothing is more frustrating that not being understood: the look of panic in someone's eyes when you approach them on the street and start to speak, and they assume you are speaking English or some other language they don't understand.



Creating motivated beginners to intermediate level speakers = the most critical stage of language learning.

You need to tell them the most important things they need to know, and link them.

Motivation comes from:
- seeing that you can do something new each time, like learning a new trick on the skateboard. Language is the coolest set of skateboard tricks on earth. This stage is not about creating superb orators, but about creating people who feel the joy. Language is joyous, creative, invention. Each time you open your mouth, you are a craftsman. You use the materials you have learnt to make something beautiful, to communicate to another person. The materials are:


- physical - the mastery of the muscles in the body
- musical - the structures of the sounds, the rhythms
- sensual - how does it feel on the breath? In the mouth?
- creative - making and remembering associations is one of the personal thrills 

We also love the thrill of getting something right: this is why self-correction is important.

Exercise:
Daily, write down your questions, and your knowledge.

1) What I know or I think I know
2) What I am wondering about / curious about / that I can have fun with == ZPD => fun / feedback / reinforcement
3) What I don't know

Theory: that we gradually shift the balance from (3) to (1) via (2). This is the Zone of Proximal Development / zone of open-mindedness.

What is the process of going from (3) to (1)?
Two stages - 
i) we need to have been told it
ii) we need to remember it

Things that are important to start off with:
A) I need to want (1) to be bigger than (3). Is learning this important to me? Do I think it is worth investing time in? If not, it is too early to start learning. Noone can learn if they do not have any initial motivating impulse.
How to impart an IMI? That is a longer process to do with the value of interaction, and overcoming fear. Breaking down fear.

Talking to people and interacting with them must be seen to have more advantages than disadvantages. Now, this is a hard thing to do, because so far, these people seem to you sullen and suspicious and moody, with their strange behaviour and rituals and smells and so on, because you have had very little interaction with them, certainly not of an intimate, warm, positive experience of interaction. One or two trips to interact with people and get to know them - and see they are just like you, only with better teeth - may do the trick.

B) I can do it - it is not beyond me. There are two types of 'this is not for me' - one is "I'm just too busy and don't have the time" - which may be true, as like anything worth getting, you get out of this what you put into it. Five minutes a week invested in a relationship gives you the type of relationship you have with the petrol pump attendant. Of course, everyone has five minutes a day, even the President of the United States. That's what empires like Candy Crush are built on. Language learning is like applying Candy Crush to real life. "I am waiting for the person in the toilet to come out. I have thirty to ninety seconds to kill. Oh look, here's my phone."

A single interaction, a single new word or understanding a day will take less than a minute. 

This is the narrative of the story - how do I and this new language fit together?
Can I do it? Will it be fun? Can I imagine myself chatting with people, maybe doing something I like that I know they do? Watching a film in that language? Can learning this language fit into an idea of myself that I want to have? Does it basically seem like a good idea?



Things that lead to motivation:
A) I must know that (1) is not empty
B) I must get pleasure from experiencing feedback and reinforcement.
Types of F&R: 
- talking to people in shops, on the street, etc
	good for: outgoing people, ppl with a lot of time; not good for: shy people, people who are time-pressured
	rewards: put a smile on people's face; feel good; feel language progression
	benefits: learn new words easily, one at a time. Each interaction like this will lead to a new word in the ZPD (within your current linguistic, social context)

Things that undermine motivation:
A) If I think that much of (1) is worthless, wrong
B) If I think that I will never get from (1) to (3)

The language is the culture.
Language learning has two parts:
- general scaffold
- culturally specific parts, generally ie how it deals with social hierarchy and class


STEPS

A:  First steps
- The most important sounds // ones that we will hear time and time again. 
- Key sounds that don't exist in your language = with mouth articulation guides / what does the mouth do?
- Word stress - how it works

B: Important grammar rules
- How to be polite (Tamil) + NGA; give dozens of examples; make sure concept is understood

C: Words you already know from your language
- provide a list? Or at least work out the principle
- words that sound X (eg TSIYA / AIRE) in your language, sound Y (TION / ARY) in English

V. Important: A, B + C to be spaced out and interweaved in the first session, with each reinforcing the other.


B: Diving In

	(1) A Party Trick with a Follow-up, a single phrase to get you going // everyone has to start somewhere // to go out and use immediately
	- could be one line from a song about the weather, anything really.

	Suggested follow-up:  "I've just started learning X, that's all I know!"

	(2) Key greetings. If you can only do this, you will show people you respect their culture.

C: Getting structured, with phrases

	(3) A skeleton / scaffold.
	This will be different for each person, depending on their experience learning languages.
	Experienced learners will be comfortable with verb tables, conjugations etc - basically a mega spreadsheet with the master rules of a language on them.

	Scaffold ideas >> ie the material for the spoken classes:
	- It's. It's not
	- I'm 

	- I / You (polite) / We
	- 10 verbs:
	(reduce from list of ten) be / have / do / say / get / go / know / take / see / come / want / give / use / call / work / ask
	- Verb pattern (3 cases only) - present. Past / future expressed with "before/after/last time/next time" etc
	
	- Prepositions (from / in / to / at / with / before / after)

	- Expressions: want to / don't want to / to have to 
	- Questions: Please / How Do You Say / What / Where / Who / When 
	- Time: Numbers 1-10; 'time' / minute / hour / day / month / year // before / after / next / last

	(4) Frequency based vocabulary
	Learning words takes time. You need to learn useful ones. Not all the colours, when green and white and red and black will do. Learning words is much easier when they are in phrases.

	(5) Salt and Pepper. Things to spice up the conversation - ie proverbs that will be amusing coming from you.
	Ritualistic greetings

	(6) What you already know: English words

How to learn any language in six months | Chris Lonsdale

1 - relevant content
2 - use as communication tool from day 1
3 - if u understand the Message - comprehensible input - you will acquire the lang
4 - physiological training, listening freq, speaking muscles
5 - psycho physiological state matters - alpha state - flow - you will learn quickly - relaxed

ACTIONS
1 - brain soaking, listen a lot, does listen to rhythms and patterns
2 - use body language - get the meaning before the words
3 - Start mixing - 10 verbs x 10 adj x 10 nouns = 1000 options
4 - focus on high freq - 1000 words = 85%; 3000 = 98% (English)
	Week 1 Tool Box: What is this? How do you say? I don't understand? What does that mean?
	Week 2 - simple pronouns, common verbs, common adjectives 
	Week 4 - Glue words, conjunctions etc
5 - get a language parent - a safe language environment, someone who communicates with you with body language, as an equal
	rules: 	- works to understand what you are saying
			- does not correct mistakes
			- confirms understanding by using correct language
			- uses words the learner knows
6 - Copy the face, observe their face
7 - Direct connect - same box different pathway - connect everything you know about the smell and look and experience of something with a sound that ALSO describes it: eg Pazham is now part of what fruit smells like.
Take time to talk about words - how they feel in the mouth, how it is to experience them in relation to the object
