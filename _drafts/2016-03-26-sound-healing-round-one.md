Guided sound meditation with aurelio.

SITTING
1 Listening
- What sounds outside and inside? can you focus on either and block the other? Can you take yourself somewhere, imagine yourself by the source of that sound. What does it look like? How does it make you feel? What colours are there?
2 Breath 
3 Inside body and outside body - where is the border? waves, pulsations, eternal river of life. Fills whole body. Nourishes every cell. Rising and falling. Is OUT different to IN? How so?  one gives more pleasure? Focus on that.
4 Breath to wind - sound of your body
5 Wind to sound
