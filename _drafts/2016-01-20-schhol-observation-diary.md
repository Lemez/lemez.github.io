Satya School Observation, 1
T - teacher; TA - teaching assistant, K - kid; G1 - Girl 1; B1 - Boy 1; etc

Ks are sat around a low square, green table, 8 or 9 of them (one keeps going out), with the T, all of them on low chairs.

It is shocking to see Ts shouting at Ks. T is showing G1 how to throw a ball, and G1 won't or can't do it. She just holds the ball above her head, refusing to let go, of if she does, she gently puts it down on the table.

T counting to 3 to get G1 to release the ball, raises her voice in frustration. Is this cultural? Is this teaching practice? Is G1 offended? She doesn't seem to be: a sweet, smiling girl with a yellow dress and a big yellow bow in her short hair.

T is generally smiling as she shouts, which shows her positive intent. But yet she shouts. T changes her game, getting G1 to throw her hands forward on the count of 3.

One girl, G2, keeps turning around to look at me and smile, she cannot concentrate on what T is doing.

B1, a tiny boy with a tiny head and big, wide eyes, who has said nothing til this point, starts screaming when TA leaves the room: "Amma, amma!" and runs out after her.

Most of the children, I notice, wearing hearing aids of different types. Perhaps T is shouting for this reason. T has a loud voice all the time now, opening her mouth wide to help with lip reading.

From my outsider's perspective, it is hard to tell which special needs label belongs to which child, if any.

I can see that a couple of the boys looks as if they may have Downs or similar, but apart from that, it is very hard to say if these labels are immediately relevant.

G3 has been playing all this time with a white plastic ring, sitting away slightly from the table. She is fascinated by it, touching it, examining it from every angle. She has an engaged half smile on her face all the time, constantly moving her head and body, fluidly, as if dancing to an inaudible groove.

T tries to get Ks to repeat sounds, P Pee Pah Poo. T seems frustrated when Ks cannot repeat, either they do not want to or cannot do what she wants.

T needs to feel validation of progress, of Ks doing something. She cannot let them be
