A commission for the Other Seder by the JCC and Yad Arts, recorded at Jackson’s Lane theatre, London, 2013. 

Dessislava Stefanova is leader of the London Bulgarian Choir – winners of BBC Radio3 Open Choir of the Year and collaborators on Electric Proms with alt-rock band Doves – and one of the most powerful singers I’ve had the pleasure of working with. In this trio with Kalina Koleva and Viv Boucherat, they sing new arrangements for Sephardic songs from the Balkans. 

With thanks to Stefan Sablić for advice with lyrics and translations.
