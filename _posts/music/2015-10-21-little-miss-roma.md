Set in a Roma settlement deep in rural Croatia, Little Miss Roma paints an intimate portrait of Roma womanhood, and highlights the conflict between women's dreams and lack of opportunities. The story is set against the backdrop of a hot weekend in July, when the Roma community celebrates its annual Roma Ball and beauty pageant, and where only one woman can be crowned Miss Roma.
