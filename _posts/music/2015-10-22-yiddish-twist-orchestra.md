<span class="newthought">A London social history</span> art project,  I set this band up with the brilliant Ben Mandelson and Robin Harris. It is damn funky <em>what if</em> from Soho's glorious post-war period. The <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/26470597/Yiddish-twist-orchestra"  >artwork</a> from Melamed, is even better. I wrote some arrangements, but didn't play on stage long, as they soon got too good and too busy. Still going <a href="http://yiddishtwistorchestra.com"  >very strong indeed.</a>
