Japanese bunraku puppetry masters Blind Summit do thought-provoking standup comedy theatre with pieces of cardboard and a huge amount of skill and deftness of touch.

Working with them was a real pleasure.

<h3>Blurb</h3>

>> Moses is a cantankerous 3 man operated puppet with a cardboard head... who lives on a table. Tonight he wants to tell you an epic story about God and Moses, life and death, and puppetry... on a table. But he gets easily distracted. 

>> Like a cross of Tommy Cooper and Eddie Izzard, this table-top philosopher and comedian is the funniest "piece of cardboard" you will ever meet.
