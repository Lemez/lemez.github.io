It was a spirited, collaborative outpouring borne out of anger and frustration surrounding the 2010 UK Elections. The country was going to hell in a handcart, and the best we could do was Nick Clegg, who turned out, unsurprisingly, to get on rather well with David Cameron, despite pretending not to. It was clear that the election was no contest at all.

So two weeks before the election, I wrote some songs with some friends, posted them on Youtube under the banner ESC2010, and invited others to do the same. Inside two weeks, we had dozens of entries, national press coverage and an spontaneous artistic response to the <strike>inciteful</strike> insightful coverage of the UK elections.
