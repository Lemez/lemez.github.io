<blockquote>
	<p>But whatever nuances the collected superstars bring to their sounds, this is all very much dance music, and it's only on the last track, '2nd Train Meditation' from Lemez Lovas, that things turn from the frenetic to the sombre. Through clarinet, far-away piano and locomotive percussion, a male voice meanders. We can't hear what he's singing, we don't know where he's going--but as Steve Reich pointed out some years ago with 'Different Trains', the allusion is uncomfortable.</p>
