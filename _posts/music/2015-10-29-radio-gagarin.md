It ran every two months at West London's finest sweat-filled basement, the Notting Hill Arts Club, for five years: six hours on a Sunday night of raucous, bonkers subversion, featuring Russian/Gypsy/kulturklash acid Balkan live bands and DJs (including me, Max Reinhardt, Misha Maltsev and Ariadne Arendt's feline alter-ego <a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/mourrka/blat-deluxe/">Mourrka</a>), plus the greatest live art team, consisting of Adrian & Zoe Philpott and Cathy Gale I've ever seen anywhere (collectively known as the Friends of Gagarin). They made cabbage races, Trotsky blues recitals, an air balalaika contest, felt bear heads and that's just the bits I can remember. The club owner even had a baby with someone he met at Gagarin.
