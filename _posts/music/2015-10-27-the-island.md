Rif Mountain is an independent co-op label specialising in underground folk music. 

Village Thing was self-dubbed ‘the alternative folk label’ way back when it began in 1970, and although it lasted only 4 years (and 20-odd releases), the music they released continues to be revered today with key albums being reissued by the likes of Light in the Attic and Sunbeam.

When Village Thing man and current fRoots editor Ian Anderson asked us to contribute to a tribute album, the yearning lyrics of "The Island", originally written and recorded by troubadour guitarist and songwriter Al Jones, immediately jumped out at us.

We recorded it at our studio, Hot Salt Beef (there's another story there), in London and released in exclusively on Echoes From The Mountain, Rif Mountain Records, 2011.
