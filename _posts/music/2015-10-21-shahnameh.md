The Shahnameh is a core work of Persian literature
Commissioned by the National Theatre, a series of workshops developing the Shaha


<h3>Blurb</h3>
Commissioned by the National Theatre, Tim Supple worked on Firdowsi’s epochal work telling the narrative of the Iranian nation from the dawn of time. The epic was adapted for theatre with the poet and leading Farsi scholar, Dick Davies in several workshops at the National’s experimental studio. At the heart of the process was two trips: India in 2009 to track the roots of ancient theatrical tradition in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, KARNATTIKA and West Bengal and THEN Tehran in 2010 for workshops, discussions, and encounters with leading artists, academics and scholars. The production remains in development with more trips to Iran and the diaspora planned.
