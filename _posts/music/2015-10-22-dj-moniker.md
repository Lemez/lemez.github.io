It was the UK General Elections in 2005, and Labour and the Conservatives were vying to outdo each other on how strict they could be on immigration. 

Again. 

In a fit of nausea I made this political mashup with audio samples courtesy of the BBC.

Thanks to <a href="https://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2005/04/309023.html?c=on#c113985"  >this Indymedia user</a> for writing out the lyrics.

<em>B: Blair
	H: Howard
	C: Churchill
	J: Journalists (various)</em>  

>>  This is my island in the sun  
Where my people have toiled since time begun  
I may sail on many a sea  
Her shores will always be home to me   
Oh Island In the Sun  
Oh I  
J: Will reduce the number of economic migrants  
H: Britain cant take them all  
Oh I'll  
J: Clampdown on illegal immigration  
B: Its important we toughen up and tighten up the system  
C: We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be  
H: For national security we must limit and control immigration  
J: Why do the voters turn away?  
B: We've expanded detention space  
H: More British back to Britain  
J: Deport immediately asylum seekers  
J: The right wingers are completely sweeping the board there  
H: Can you imagine what it feels like?  
J: Not genuine  
B: Genuine refugees  
J: Not genuine  
H: Should be in prison not roaming our streets  
Oh Island In the Sun  
B: Clandestinely or illegally  
H: Immigration is chaotic and out of control  
H: More British back to Britain  
B: That's what I think  
B: We've expanded detention space  
Walls come tumbling down.......  
J: It's been widely predicted that the turn out will be low  
B: Thank you, thanks very much.
