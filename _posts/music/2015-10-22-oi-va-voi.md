<span class="marginnote">At this show the crowd even sang me Happy Birthday. sigh. Happy Days.</span>

<span class="newthought">I founded, </span>wrote for and led a band for 7 years. On stage, I sang and played trumpet. People seemed to like us, and we played some decent shows. We were signed to Outcaste/EMI, and then Virgin/V2. I was lucky enough to work at length with some outrageously talented people, like KT Tunstall, Mike Spencer, Paul Epworth, Maurice El Medioni.

This was a longstanding labour of love: undertaken at a time when I was researching deeply into my roots and identity, and found a community of musicians and voyagers to share it with.
