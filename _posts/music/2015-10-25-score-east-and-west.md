A great little commission from the JCC (now London's Jewish cultural centre, JW3), and Yad Arts. Together with multi-instrumentalists Rohan Kriwaczek and Moshikop, we scored a live soundtrack to this lovely Yiddish silent comedy.

We performed it several times in London, then in Paris and Jerusalem, and had a ball.
