I first met the British documentary director <a href="https://vimeo.com/user10836861">Lucy Kaye </a>when I saw Together Alone, her graduation film from the National Film and Television School. It was such a touching, sensitive portrayal of the difficulties of old age in London that I went straight up to her after the screening and had to thank her.

So we were of course delighted when she asked me and my studio partner Yaniv to compose the music for her first Channel 4 film, "The Wild Ones" (which Channel 4 cheesily renamed 'Teen Horse Whisperers', but that's another story.)

>> Impact Pupil Referral Unit, in Bootle, Liverpool, provides a last chance for teenagers expelled from school to gain qualifications. This term, seven pupils get to leave the Unit to try a new way of learning in an unlikely sanctuary for rescued horses, in the heart of this run-down neighborhood. Run by local resident Bernadette Langfield, several wild ponies that she saved from being culled need taming. But these horses, like the pupils have their own troubled backgrounds and in order for a relationship between them to develop, both horses and teenagers have to first deal with their own behavioral difficulties.

What Lucy made was a beautiful, sensitive, very moving film. Sadly it can't be embedded on other websites, but I heartily recommend watching it <a href="https://vimeo.com/54937192">on Lucy's Vimeo page.</a>Right now.
