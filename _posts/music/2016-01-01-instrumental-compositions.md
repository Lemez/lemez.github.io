Live music commissioned for the Other Seder at the Tricycle Theatre, directed by Mark Rosenblatt for Yad Arts and JCC London.

We were commissioned to write music for the four short plays that make up the evening. 

Egypt Jazz - is inspired by John Zorn's Masada Trio.
African - is inspired by the genius of Konono No. 3
Romanian - is inspired by the Romanian gypsy recordings of Gabi Lunca and Nicolae Gutsa.

Below is a video of the recording of Romanian, at Moshikop's beautiful studio in Walthamstow, East London.
