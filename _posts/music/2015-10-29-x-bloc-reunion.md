It was one of those gigs you dream about. Together with Josephine, my partner in YaD Arts, we proposed a festival of music and culture to the Barbican Centre. They said yes, and I got to invite the greatest artists I had ever met, to be in the same place at the same time.

<p>The idea under-lying the Barbican's X-Bloc Reunion is both simple and inspired: to pull together all the strands of the Soviet empire's indigenous musics - from the austerely traditional to the most liberated post-punk rock - and let them ferment together in a 10-day festival. </p>

<p>X-Bloc Reunion is a music festival, not a political event, but on the opening night, the volatile and often tragic history of the former Soviet states in the Caspian and Caucasus never seemed far away. It is remarkably brave - putting it mildly - for the Barbican to devote a whole series of concerts to the music of the former eastern bloc, and even more brave to kick off with a show featuring celebrities from Azerbaijan and Armenia, two now-independent countries that were in a state of undeclared war for much of the 1990s.</p>
