There are a few artists to whom lyrics really matter. When those artists are people who you chime with emotionally and politically, the entire process of songwriting is a life-affirming activity.

This is how it was with Laszlo Kollar Klemencz, aka Lazlo from Kistehen / Little Cow.

The reason he has so many names is because he is Hungarian, and there was much debate about what to call his first foray into the UK market.
