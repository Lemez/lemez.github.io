I used to work in a <a href="http://www.landfmusic.com">commercial music studio</a>. An international campaign for an underwear model came in. My response was this. My good friend and partner Yaniv Fridel, as well as the clients themselves, were persuaded that this was a good idea. It got them a lot of attention: we were promptly taken off the job. Listening back, it marked a highpoint in my relationship with the world of making music to flog crap by.
