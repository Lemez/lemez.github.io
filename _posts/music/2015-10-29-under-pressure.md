I used to work in a commercial music studio. An international campaign for an underwear model came in. My response was this. My partner, and the clients both allowed themselves to be persuaded that this was a good idea. It got them a lot of attention, but not in the way that they hoped. We were taken off the job. I still love it almost more than anything else I have ever done.
