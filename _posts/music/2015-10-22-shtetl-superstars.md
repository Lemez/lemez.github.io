<p>Yury Gurzhy and I released a compilation CD called Shtetl Superstars on Trikont in 2006. It was very well received, so we got to thinking - instead of another compilation, why don't we write the songs ourselves? And so we did, over four years, and numerous trips to Berlin.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">The band</span> ceased to exist before our debut album was ever released internationally, yet we got some great international shows. The artwork, courtesy of <a href="http://shmariadne.com/">Ariadne Arendt</a>, was pure genius. Our official merchandise included a salted, dried fish necklace with lyrics printed on the ribbon, and customised condensed milk. I'm banking on the whole package being rediscovered one day as a lost treasure, along the lines of Sugarman. Ahem.

<p>Somehow or other, the songs made it onto the soundtrack of a flagship BBC documentary, when Louis Theroux went venturing into the West Bank to meet settlers with a yearning for armageddon. We didn't get paid, but - hey - that's showbusiness !</p>

Never properly released, so I'm officially free to make up whatever quotes I want. Except this one, which came from a festival:

<blockquote><p>"We predict their debut album will be one of the biggest hits of the decade"</p>
