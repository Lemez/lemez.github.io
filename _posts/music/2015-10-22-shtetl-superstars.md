<p><span class="newthought">The band</span> ceased to exist before our debut album was ever released internationally, yet we got some great international shows. The artwork, courtesy of <a href="http://shmariadne.com/">Ariadne Arendt</a>, was pure genius. Our official merchandise included a salted, dried fish necklace with lyrics printed on the ribbon, and customised condensed milk. I'm banking on the whole package being rediscovered one day as a lost treasure, along the lines of Sugarman. Ahem.
