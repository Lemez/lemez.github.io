I was commissioned by Freemuse, alongside Bosnian anthropologist Maya Medich, to go to Belarus around the time of the 2006 Presidential Elections to report on political censorship of music and musicians. 

Belarus was then, as it is now, ruled by the 'last dictator in Europe', Aleksander Lukashenko, and with 'coloured' revolutions taking place across the post-Soviet world, the government was cracking down mightily hard on oppositional politics of any kind, including artists and musicians.
