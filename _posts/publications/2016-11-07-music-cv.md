 Back in London, he co-founded Lemez & Fridel, a central London recording and production studio, writing original music and lyrics for everything from big game developers like Smule and Ubisoft to children's theatre companies Tall Stories and Peut-Etre and starting the bands Shtetl Superstars and Yiddish Twist Orchestra.
 
His fifteen plus years of collaboration with Josephine Burton (Yad Arts, Dash Arts) has seen them running long-standing club nights at the ICA and Notting Hill Arts Club, programming major festivals at the Barbican and South Bank Centre, curating Arab hip-hop at the Roundhouse and performing his original score for the Molly Picon silent film "East and West" in London, Paris and Jerusalem.
