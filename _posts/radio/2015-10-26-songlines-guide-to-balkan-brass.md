As a young trumpet player bored of jazz, there were only two choices as far as I knew: Gypsy or Cuban. I couldn't afford the airfare to Miami, let alone Cuba, and I knew Russian, so I figured if I didn't know Romanes, at least I could blag it in Serbian.

And so began a lifelong love affair with Gypsy brass music. Somehow I found <a href="http://www.galbeno.com/">Amala</a>, a Gypsy music school, and called them up. Instead of going to their school, could they find me a family to live with play with for a month? "Sure," said the cracked voice at the end of the line, "you just come."

And so with a trumpet, a few deutschmarks and not much else, I found myself getting off a train in Belgrade station to meet Dragan Ristic, a cheerful, bald chain-smoker who turned out to be a top guitarist and local political Roma activist from a well-known Belgrade theatre family.
