This was a fun project: albeit one with severe undertones of narcissism.

Some great things have come out of it though: I got back in touch with some wonderful people from my past who I haven't spoken to for far too long. Who said that technology was a lonely business?  

Future plans for this site include: pointing people here instead of writing long repetitive emails, and writing down my thoughts and refering back to them later when I've forgotten everything.

I used <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a static site generator written in Ruby, and <a href="https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics">Liquid</a>, an odd language written for Shopify that is severely restrictive, but at least gives the old gray matter a bit of a workout. Rather than making pages in html or html.erb as usual, I opted for the world of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>.

The styling is mostly down to the lovely <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">Tufte CSS.</a>

The map page is built using the Datamaps wrapper for the "how on earth did anyone do anything before this?" godsend of a data visualisation library <a href="http://datamaps.github.io/">D3</a>.

The site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>.
