This is not one of those stories about how I've been playing around with machines since I was a small boy, and discovered that the machine and I were actually one and the same.

It is a story about how I started a startup called <a href="http://www.tonguesten.com">Tonguesten</a> and discovered that London was a great place to be a computer, and a nightmare place to start a startup. I won't bore you with the reasons here, but the infographic on the right says it all: London has a mighty financial sector with deep pockets, and a neanderthal visa regime for overseas programmers. Little startups who aren't able to build their own products need big investment upfront, or will die before their coffee gets cold.
