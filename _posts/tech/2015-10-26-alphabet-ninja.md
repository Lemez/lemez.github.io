I was learning to code at the same time as a new little person came into our lives, and so it was only natural that I would try to make a little toy for her.

I stumbled across the wonderful icon repository <a href="http://thenounproject.com">Noun Project</a>, added some sounds from <a href="http://landfmusic.com">our studio</a>.

I taught myself the basics of Javascript and CSS animations and transitions, and it was good to go.

My daughter's now three and she still asks to play 'the sounds game' almost every time she sees me opening up my laptop.
