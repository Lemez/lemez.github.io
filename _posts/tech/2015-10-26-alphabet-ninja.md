I was learning to code at the same time as a new little person came into our lives, and so it was only natural that I would try to make a little toy for her.

I taught myself the basics of CSS animations and transitions, alongside Javascript logic.

It was fun, and most importantly, my little one loved it, and still asks to play it nearly every day.
