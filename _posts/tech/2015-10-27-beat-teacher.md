A small application written in about four days as an offering to Adishakti Theatre, the wonderful centre for contemporary dramatic arts in Auroville, Tamil Nadu.

Built together with design help from Arvind Rane, and drumming input from Bhavin Patel, it is designed for students who finish their eleven-day reseidential Source of Performance Energy workshop, to help them to continue with their mizhavu drum practice.
