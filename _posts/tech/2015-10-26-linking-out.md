I hate LinkedIn. Or rather, I hate the way that social media insists on relentless self-promotion, urging us to trumpet every half-success from the rafters and dress up meh as amazeballs.

Traditionally, there has only been one document in which white lies were the norm - the CV. All honest folk could live with that, however, because we only need to look at them once every few years at most.	

As a paradigm of dystopia, LinkedIn is hard to beat. It makes money through its jobs board, which targets you based on your CV



I have little doubt that it will
