Having just spent a week with Dr Nigel Osborne, speaking to experts in education, healthcare and Indian arts, here are some personal observations.

After seven days of hands-on music therapy workshops, with participants ranging from toddlers and babies with special needs to 80+ year old rural villagers in a palliative care setting, a project has taken shape. It was not planned in advance, but rather it emerged spontaneously from the sheer enthusiasm and energy of everyone involved, both participants and facilitators. 

In a nutshell, I have walked into a project that will take up an increasing chunk of my time - something that was very far from my mind one week ago, when I walked into a spacious lecture hall in the Sri Aurobindo society one Friday morning not knowing what to expect. 

Presenting that day were Dr Nigel Osborne, Emeritus Professor of Music at Edinburgh University and two of his former students: Emmeline McCracken, a practising music therapist, and Christina Bain, a community music specialist.

Dr Nigel took the floor. He is a kindly bear of a man who speaks with precision. In a deep voice, resonant over the roar of the ceiling fans, he changed my perception about music therapy utterly. 

Previously, it had seemed to me a worthy, yet unexciting area of medicine - a 'soft' offshoot of psychology, performed by happy clappy singalong guitarists.

I thought it was meant to lift people's spirits, and that alone. Of course there is nothing wrong with making people feel better through music, but I just didnt see how it could inspire me personally, having spent so many years performing on a stage.

One of the first names that Dr Nigel spoke that day was Ibn Sina, or Avicenna. Now I really perked up my ears. I knew that the golden age of Arabic science and philosophy, where titans like Al Kindi and Al Farabi took the great works of the Greeks to dazzling new heights, was also a golden age of music, and that these great theoreticians was the first serious musicologists. Of the three books that I had brought out with me to Pondicherry - two of them were about this exact same subject.<span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class='sidenote'><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon"  >Sa'adyah Gaon</a> on the Influence of Music, by HG Farmer, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Music-World-Islam-Socio-Cultural-Study/dp/0814329705"  >Music in the World of Islam</a>, by Amnon Shiloah</span>

The debt the Europeans have to Arabic music is well known of course, not even referring to the Catholic <em>adhan</em>, or call to prayer.
