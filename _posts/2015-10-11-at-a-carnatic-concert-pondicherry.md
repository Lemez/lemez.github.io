Just back from my first Carnatic concert. There is something about the simplicity, the sheer unpretentiousness of India that makes its greatness all the more impressive.

Precision, grace and devotion, breathtaking technical ability, deep communication on stage, exquisite melodies, satisfying narrative arc over the whole concert: these are just some of the qualities that make a Carnatic concert, lasting three hours, fly by.

The musicians enjoy themselves: that is a rare enough thing in itself.

What more perfect school of music is there? Where else is there an art form as balanced as this?
Where a musician can weep sorrow one moment and shred like Hendrix the next?

I would dedicate the next decade of my life to understanding this art. 

The concert was that good.
