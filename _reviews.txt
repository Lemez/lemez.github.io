> From Asphalt Tango, the German label known for its gypsy and Romanian records comes a new release from Berlin via the former Soviet Union. With a sound aiming at Russendisko meets Manu Chao, singer songwriter Irina Dubrovskaya has assembled a first-rate band of local émigrés for this project of ‘vocal postcards’ – evocative stories and poems filled with fragments of memory that constitute a new kind of post-Soviet urban folk music, half village and half tower block. Well that’s what the press blurb says anyway: despite the moments of beauty that certainly exist, this is an album that will have trouble winning over new non-Russian speaking fans. All three stars above are for the sound: delicate and dream-like with swirling organs, music boxes, toy xylophones and classy lo-fi electric guitar from Leonid Soybelman, ex-frontman of Estonian avant-gardistes Ne Zhdali. But where Ersatz Musika convinces in the quality of its sound, it fails to excite overall. As you open the CD there is an immediate hint why: the poem on the first page - lyrics from one of the songs perhaps? – seems not plaintive and evocative but badly translated and downright pretentious. The overall impression is one of extreme seriousness devoid of wit: press releases talking about ‘the sound of the Slavic soul’ hardly help matters. But the main downfall is the singing: Dubrovskaya’s voice struggles to carry the songs, and while the curious sound world might spark your interest, the singer – sad to say – won’t keep it.

> When Frank London, the trumpeter from the Klezmatics, first put together Frank London’s Klezmer Brass Allstars to perform – you guessed it – classics from the klezmer repertoire in a Balkan brass style, the result was an instant world music hit.  Now, in a similar vein, German clarinettist Christian David and UK drummer Guy Schalom have teamed up with an excellent traditional brass band from Kodyma in Western Ukraine, consisting of five members of the Baranovsky / Voronyuk family. Judging by audience reactions from their recent European live shows, their fusion of klezmer with funky brass still sounds very fresh, although their approach is different from FLKBA – less of the irreverent humour, and more of an ethnomusicological seriousness. But it’s not as heavy-going as that might sound: when they have had enough of tearing through fiery dance tunes, this band have a unique extra gear to go into – traditional Ukrainian folk-songs with accordion and beautiful close sung harmonies – that create a fascinating aural counterpart to the standard klezmer freylekhs, sher and hora tunes. These songs offer a glimpse of what could have been the best klezmer record since Odessan singer Alec Kopyt first put a band together – a full-blooded album of rootsy, raw, Jewish-inspired music. The band are excellent, but the direction feels too safe: it is mainly Balkan brass style arrangements of klezmer tunes – good though they are – rather than a musical exploration of the much deeper fusion that the Baranovsky family represent.

> From US politicians to Serbian Roma trumpeters, the lure of the dynasty can be too great to resist. Many top Balkan brass players – like Feat Sejdić and current golden boy Ekrem Mamutović – once earned their chops in their father’s, or even their grandfather’s band, and now it is the turn of Marko, 17-year old son of Serbian trumpet star Boban Marković, to take over the reins. The record is hit and miss: the band are on fire as always, and Marko is obviously bursting with ideas, throwing jazz, funk and pop into the mix, but what the album clearly lacks is the guiding ear of an external producer to pull everything into a coherent whole. When he does team up with an experienced outsider like Shantel for Pijem (Me Mangava), the result is outstanding, all head-nodding drum patterns and catchy, lilting vocal lines. Elsewhere though it can get a bit out of control: tracks like Evo Je Mlada and Džumbus Funk with their big Hollywood-style brass lines and jazz solos are brash and over-ambitious. It’s all gone a bit showbiz: the Cuban influenced Latino Čoček wouldn’t sound out of place in a Las Vegas ballroom; Bubamara feels like an encore at the end of a long, tiring tour: somebody keeps jumping in and ruining an otherwise beautiful rendition of the standard Ne Kuni Me, Ne Ruži Majko with pointless blasts of Bregovic’s frenetic party number Kalashnikov. A good example of why great musicians shouldn’t produce their own albums.

> Italian brass music has been a revelation over the past few years: a dramatic Sicilian sound personified by groups like Banda Ionica; the ska-jazz fire of trumpeter Roy Pacci; and the excellent Circo Cabaret Inferno compilations by top local world music label Felmay. So it was with some expectation that I put this one into the CD player: sadly there is no press release or advance information about the band, but happily the music does the talking more than eloquently. The band call the album ‘a hypothetical voyage over Adriatic sea harbours’: with the amount of sounds and influences they try to cram in here, captain Claudio Prima on accordion and vocals certainly has his work cut out keeping a steady ship. But keep it he does: this is one of those projects that really shouldn’t work, but for some reason just does – from the slow, drunken klezmer inflections of ‘Tourbanda’ to the funky snare-led Cretan song ‘To Ghaisemi’ to the full-on Roma style dance party Albanian traditional tune ‘Lake Populake’. Instrumentally the band are spot on: first mate Redi Hasa on cello stands out in particular for his gorgeous, snaking supporting melodies that import a more Arabic feel on occasion, and ex-Kocani Orkestar lead man Naat Veliov is on hand to add some sublime trumpet solos. Occasional unnecessary avant-jazz meanderings keep the album one star away from all five – but overall this is a first rate, carefully crafted record jam-packed with tasty Mediterranean morsels.

> It’s been twenty years now since Yorkshire’s finest first serenaded John Peel with a Ukrainian folk song in a punk rock reversioning, and since then they have travelled the world with their unique interpretations, rich with accordion, mandolin and sweet traditional vocal harmonies. All hail the Ukrainians! But listening to this live recording from Poland, released to celebrate their historic anniversary, it is difficult not to conclude that the Ukes have a problem: where once they were in a narodniy punk league of their own, now their sound has been caught up and overtaken by musicians from the old country. Firstly Ukrainian language music is now mainstream, and secondly countless Ukrainian rock bands seem to be copying their shtick, and doing it better: next to stadium-filling local heroes like Vopli Vidopliassova, the Ukes are more Chas’n’Dave than rock’n’roll. Don’t get me wrong, the band can still fire off a mean tune, but now that everyone in world music is singing songs from everywhere like those old boundaries never existed, you can’t help feeling they need to develop another angle. One star for the packaging courtesy of the ever impressive Koka label, and another one for nostalgia.

> It is about time that Brighton DJ and producer Max Pashm, who has been making high octane gypsy klezmer dance tracks for as long as anyone can remember, put out an international release. Pashm is certainly a pioneer in the Balkan/klezmer clubbing scene, and on this long awaited new album he has assembled a fine cast of musicians to weave Yiddish, Bulgarian, Greek and Cretan melodies into his funky, humorous cut ‘n’ paste electronica.  With many records in this genre – one ear firmly turned towards the dancefloor – it can be hard to fully appreciate what’s going on without a large stack of bass bins nearby, but there is plenty of great playing to keep head nodding commuters engaged too, most notably from Laura Anstee on cretan lyra, George Kypreos on bouzouki and baglamas and Merlin Shepherd on clarinet. On the electronic side of things, the production has a ravey breakbeat feel that recalls the early 90s sound of bands like TransGlobal Underground, so if you like your beats old school, then you are in for a treat. Welcome back, Max Pashm.

> From the moment this one dropped onto the CD player, a huge relief: La Brass Banda are not one of the umpteen gypsy soundalike bands, but something much fresher –  a deeply original gypsy funk style brass band who play their stylish compositions with intent, fine chops and bags of humorous character. Somewhere off the shores of Lake Chiemsee in Upper Bavaria, this five piece of three horns, drums, bass and vocals have come up with what can only be described as a killer combination of big riffs, Lalo Schifrin style, driving arrangements and all-out floor fillers. The influences in the horns flit from Tex Mex mariachi in the sassy opening track, “Brassbanda,” to tuba-driven ska on the excellent “Autobahn,” and elsewhere elements of New Orleans, South London 80s pop, the Balkans and local Bavarian polka are all thrown into the mix with equally good judgement. The production is tight and unobtrusive, letting the phenomenal playing shine through and never overdoing the effects, bells and whistles. Forget the gypsy compilations, the blow-hards and the soundalike orkestars and treat yourself to a pure slice of fuel injected Suddeutsch funk.

Aneinu: Hasidic Orthodox Music from the Festival of the Torah in Jerusalem
Wergo SM1628 2

 > There are two ways to look at klezmer music in Israel: the first, that it has never been much in fashion – most Israelis treat its appearance on TV for Jewish festivals like the Queen’s speech at Xmas, to be tolerated rather than loved; the second, that it has never gone out of fashion, still performed at religious Hasidic functions and feasts much as it has been for many years. Moshe Berlin is one of the best known clarinet players in the celebratory Israeli Hasidic Orthodox tradition, and throughout this live field recording from a jubilant annual Simchat Torah festival in Jerusalem in 1992, his backing band of drums, guitar and keyboard and what sounds like hundreds of Yeshiva students sing wordless nigunim and religious folksongs from across the Jewish world like their lives depend on it. Berlin’s style of klezmer relies a lot less than its US cousins on jazz and adventurous arrangements, and a lot more on the old fashioned values of simple harmony, clearly articulated playing and directness of intent. The playing, however good, is let down by one crucial factor – the quality of the recording, which is awful. It sounds like it was recorded on a pre-historic mobile phone inside a bag under a table, and the effect is like gate-crashing a wedding when the atmosphere is starting to get lairy. Strictly for students and klezmasochists.

> Out of all the myriad bands out there deconstructing and then rebuilding new repertoire out of klezmer and Balkan music, there can be no doubt that the Amsterdam Klezmer Band are one of the most accomplished bands around. Famed for their cooking live shows and ultra-tight horn section, it was 2007’s Remixed album that really set them apart, pairing their dancefloor friendly licks with top DJs and producers, and inviting Yiddish music to let loose in the global gypsy club revolution. Now they are back with Zaraza, their fifth original studio album and the second for ground-breaking label Frankfurt label Essay, and their recipe of new compositions with sparkling clarinet, sax and brass melodies and infectious accordion propelled grooves is as tasty as ever. The ace in their pack is undoubtedly singer Alec Kopyt – an iconic Odessa born raconteur whose early recordings as Poza are essential – and here his trademark sweet, sandpaper voice is on typically fine form, lamenting about life on “Takaj Zhizn,” although on the intricate Balkan-sounding “Gde”, the vocals feel like something of an afterthought, as Kopyt’s voice isn’t allowed enough space to shine above the densely layered instrumentation. Alongside a plethora of action-packed instrumentals, the best track on the album is “Op Een Goppe” in Dutch – I have no idea what it means, but the rhythm of the language works a treat, somehow giving the band a lighter, more organic feel. All in all, another solid, impressive release from one of the best in the business.

> With no bass and no out and out lead singer, Boom Pam have a unique signature sound: just two guitars, tuba and drums. This means that the cult Tel Aviv surf mashup four piece have the luxury of being able to take on pretty much anything and have it come out sounding like they own it. Their original source of inspiration, 70s Greek Israeli guitar legend Aris San, is still present, but his trademark oriental surf sound is less central to this, their second studio outing. They obviously still enjoy crunching up the Balkan wedding-style repertoire material (“Krai Dunavsko”) that played a big role in their eponymous debut, but on Puerto Rican Nights they cast the net wider, taking in US cult guitarman Dick Dale (“The Wedge”), Spanish movie soundtracks (“Ay Carmela”) and covers of classic old Israeli songs (“Shayeret Harohvim”). Man of the moment, Balkan Beat Box frontman Tomer Yosef, swaggers in to deliver a surefire radio hit in the shape of “Ani Rotse Lazuz” (I Want To Move), which is a grinding “hands in the air” dancefloor gem. Overall it’s a quirky, loveable kind of record more than an obviously commercial one, but for a band with this much personality and humour, there’s no telling where they could go if they really put their mind to it.

> Continuing on from their excellent recent releases, Berlin label Eastblok are back with another delicious find, this time from Milano, Italy. Fez Club play what can only be lovingly described as bastard music here on their third studio album Figli Di Madre Ignota (Sons of Unknown Mothers) –a wild concoction of  klezmer, balkan, spaghetti western, brass and rock. With its thousands of kilometres of coastline facing Spain, the Balkans and North Africa, Italy has a distinguished history of absorbing sounds from elsewhere, chewing them up and spitting them out again in a unique, organic way. One of the most delightful brass records of the past few years came not from the Balkans, but from Italy, courtesy of Sicily’s Banda Ionica, and the good news is that trumpet maestro Roy Paci is also on production duties here. The references are too many to cover in a short review, but standout tracks include Theme from Paradise, a groovy, kitschy number in English with sparkling mariachi horns, the Tom Waits-ish circus vibe of Sadoman with its snarling bass clarinet, and the Slavic ska-punk party thrashout Ole Ole. Highly recommended.

> Reprezent is the second album from the man who is fast becoming the greatest Czech musical export since Dvořák and Janáček, and even for newcomers, the instant appeal of Radoslav ‘Gipsy’ Banga is not hard to fathom: driving upbeat Roma instrumentation, incisive lyrics and fluid vocal delivery, all combined with plenty of tongue in cheek hip-hop swagger. Where much European hip-hop fails due to its aspiration to be nothing more than a pale imitation of its American heroes, Gipsy.cz defiantly bucks the trend: yes, he can’t resist occasional gangsta clichés of posturing, money and bitches, but when a musician can combine the sun-drenched good vibes of rumba diva Věra Bílá (“Benga Beating”) with devastating one-liners about overcoming racism in Czech society (“Barvolepej Svet”, Colour-Blind World), you just have to sit up and take notice. Alongside the sharp lyrical delivery, bouncing guitar and accordion rhythm sections, are plenty of catchy vocal hooks, and Banga is no slouch at singing either. The whole package is so good that even the rapping in dodgy English is somehow convincing. Overall, a record that is both great world music and first rate pop in the best sense of the word.

> Asphalt Tango, home to many fine Balkan and Gypsy releases including the wonderful series Classics From a Bygone Era, have always tried to push the boundaries of modern styles. Austrian based collective La Cherga, largely made up of musicians from former Yugoslavia, is an interesting addition to the roster: mostly 90s Everything But The Girl style electronica plus trumpet, saxophone and accordion licks a la Balkan Beat Box, and laid-back English vocals from singer Inna Karamarkovic doing her best Dido impression. It’s the kind of record that works best at a bar in the background: pleasing melodies, good dubby grooves and a lead vocal that is always easy on the ear. When you listen closer though, cracks begin to appear: the acoustic instruments lack punch, the drum programming is not always as crisp as it should be and if the lyrics – eg “This groove always makes you stupid, let your hips just move so freely” – are meant to be ironic, the joke has got lost somewhere in translation. La Cherga try hard to go beyond the Balkan stereotypes, but they are at their most convincing when they do just that, for example on the headbanging, four to the floor, trumpet ska of Rembetiko. “We are going nowhere,” sings Inna Karamarkovic repeatedly on opening track Cooking Dub comes to a close. Well, I wouldn’t have put it so harshly myself, but she has a point: overall this is a promising but incomplete debut from a good band in need of a sharp pair of digital scissors.

*****

> It is what every reviewer hopes for, but rarely gets: an absolute gem of a record that arrives on the doorstep out of nowhere. I’ll get straight to the point: not since Czech star Iva Bittova – of the world’s most hypnotic voices and performers – first cooed and squealed her way into our consciousness with the seminal Bittova & Fajt in 1987, has the simplicity of a voice and drums recording felt so powerful and accomplished. Like another father and daughter duo, Alim and Ferghana Qasimov, the Masloboevs take traditional songs and make them completely their own, but where intensity of the Qasimovs’ poetry is realised through their stratospheric vocal range, Anastasia is quite the opposite: contained and understated, floating above her father’s loosely woven percussive soundscape that comprises drums, glockenspiel, coffee pots and even the kitchen sink. The voice and percussion line-up might be deliberately primitive but the result is anything but: “Holidays” rocks out like a Siberian folk choir doing gospel at a Southern Baptist church; “Bird” is a moody, cinematic winter soundtrack with rolling drums lolloping across the steppe like the night train to Irkutsk, accompanied by owls and crickets; “Arrow” is a timeless sounding folk song with enchanting close harmonies and a beautifully repetitive, incantational quality. Unreservedly recommended.

> The Balkan scene in Vienna has been quietly cooking away for some years now: first local DJ Ulf Lindemann aka Dunkelbunt worked with everyone from Fanfare Ciocarlia to the Amsterdam Klezmer Band and set dancefloors alight at his Balkan Hot Step nights; Binder and Krieglstein with their quirky klezmer inflected sub-pop, and now the debut record of Czech/Macedonian DJ Ahilea. Most of the album is not bass-heavy club anthems, but lighter, more obviously swinging mid-tempo grooves: plenty of chopped up guitar and accordion chops alongside tapan drum rhythms to keep things chugging along nicely. While the largely instrumental grooves tend to be understated, there are plenty of thrilling, snaking solos from a stylish cross-Balkan émigré band: on ‘Kalabalak’, Turkish Macedonian clarinet player  Hidan Mamudov sounds every bit as commanding as the great Selim Sesler, and accordion player Mitke Sarlandziev on opening track ‘Café Svetlana’ sounds like he could go on conjuring up those lithe, meandering melodies all night. There’s nothing groundbreaking here, and it’s not the kind of record that will crash its way into the mainstream, but there’s plenty of subtle quality here to keep Balkanheads quietly nodding in approval.

> By now, the story of how 80s rock band The Wedding Present reworked some Ukrainian folk tunes for a BBC John Peel Session, and ended up with a minor chart hit on their hands is the stuff of legend. Much horilka has flowed since those heady days – Cossack culture is hip back home again, and their student fan-base has been usurped by upstarts Gogol Bordello – but the trusty Ukes show no sign of tiring. With their trademark soaring field harmonies above the chugging, old school rock n roll ethos, and traditional bandura lute and accordion dancing over distortion pedals, Diaspora is a return to form. Amongst their covers this time around, Brahms’s Hungarian Dances – it is basically Ukrainian according to the Ukes – and T Rex’s Children of the Revolution. It’s all typically rousing stuff, particularly the supercharged Brahms reworking ‘Emigranty’ and the violin led thrashout ‘Marusya Bohuslavka’, where the heroic maiden Marusya rescues some Cossacks stuck in a 17th century epic poem. You’ll need a strong stomach for some of the lyrics – which can get a bit too strident and flag-waving for my taste – but if you can take the rose-tinted eulogies to the great nation with irony, Diaspora is an hour of classic Ukrainians material: fast, furious, and very vodka-friendly.

> Israel has for years been home to a number of masterful exponents of traditional Arabic, Turkish and Persian instruments such as ud, ney and saz, who, through interplay with both Eastern and Western art musics and the many local folk and Jewish liturgical traditions, manage to create a dynamic scene that sounds quite unlike any of its neighbours. Step up Amir Perelman, a cello and Turkish bouzouk player, whose New Song Of Jerusalem Ensemble’s debut album gets its first international release here. The instrumentation of the ensemble – violin, cello, bouzouk, piano, clarinet and percussion – is designed expressly to float between genres, coaxing out lush textures while taking in associations from Satie to Oum Kalsoum to Hasidic wordless nigun songs. Much like Tunisian oud player Anouar Brahem, it is the sheer beauty and space in the arrangements that gets you here. ‘Ya’ala Ya’ala’ is a case in point: starting out with just bouzouk and percussion playing the simple melody over Ofir Tal’s repeated piano drone, the theme is developed with increasing intricacy until the ecstatic solo section, where violinist Oren Tsor unfurls spectacularly over the hypnotic rhythmic drone like a peacock. The pace is not all stately explorations of mood: ‘The 5th Tov U Meitiv’ is a partly clarinet-driven tango,  and ‘Hushi’ is more an uptempo Eastern jazz workout. But it is on the more meditative, spiritual numbers that this band really excel. A record to make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.

> UK based Israeli bassist Daphna Sadeh has been making music at the frontline of jazz and Jewish music for many years, and in this, her third full length album and first on John Zorn’s pioneering Tzadik label, it sounds as though she has finally found a home worthy of her talents: this must be one of the most approachable and swinging releases in the whole catablogue. Granted, there is nothing groundbreaking in her cherry-picking of Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Arabic traditions, but you can tell she has spent time bringing together a band who really bring out the best in each other. On the first track ‘Queen of Sheba’, Eddie Hession’s light-fingered accordion opens the record with a jaunty step that stays with you throughout; multi-talented clarinettist Stewart Curtis has been in many bands over the years, but has never sounded better, letting rip on the delicate arrangement of the liturgical song ‘Avinu’ with a flair that would put much bigger US names to shame. Every one of her compositions sings, and percussionist Ronen Kozokaro, guitarist Ivor Goldberg and trombonist Mark Bassey form a tight unit that never misses a beat. In this passionate, highly accessible record, Sadeh has obviously found her voice as a stylish composer and bandleader with a talent for making the complicated sound extraordinarily simple. Recommended.

> Since their original gypsy compilation back in 1999, Rough Guide to the Music of the Gypsies, enough has gone on in terms of public perception to warrant a slew of more specialised compilations – the Music of Hungarian Gypsies, Balkan Gypsies and Romanian Gypsies. Now, as Rough Guides pan out with this second edition to take stock of the whole scene, it is clearly popular enough to have evolved into a genre in its own right: gypsy music. So where to start? All the big Balkan names are rightly here: Romanian brass band Fanfare de Ciocarlia kick us off with ‘Que Dolor’, their storming Spanish language version of their first hit ‘Iag Bari’; Taraf de Haidouks’ interpretation of Khachaturyan’s ‘Waltz from Masquerade’ shows them at their sublime best; the thrashed out, over-produced ‘Guglo Kafava’ doesn’t do Bosnia’s Mostar Sevdah Reunion justice at all. Alongside the excellent buleria ‘Un Compromiso/Toda Una Vida’ by gutsy flamenco revivalists Son De La Frontera, and Stochelo Rosenberg’s gypsy jazz Stevie Wonder cover ‘I Wish’ are a few stranger choices:!Dela Dap’s electro pop would be better served by separate album as it sits awkwardly in this acoustic mix, as does ‘Barish’ from Rajasthani band Musafir, an afterthought tacked on at the end. Three stars for the album itself, one more for the gritty, impressive bonus CD: a whole album by Hungarian Bela Lakatos, which is well worth the cover price alone.

But before you reach for the industrial strength earplugs and rakija, some background. Vrelo was founded in 1999 as a folk ensemble with eighteen female singers and seven traditional musicians performing Serbian ritual songs. Not musically unlike its much better known cousin Bulgarian folk singing, as practised so wonderfully by groups like Les Mysteres des Voix Bulgares and Trio Bulgarka, Serbian close vocal harmony songs as sung accapella by Vrelo – now an eight piece with bass and drums – is every bit as spine-tingling. Their subsequent evolution in 2003 into a speaker shattering rock and electronic folk outfit is not as scary as it sounds: tracks like the opener ‘Karavilje Lale’, and ‘Teralo Stojne’with their roaring bass and punching syncopated snares under the soaring unison folk song doesn’t make for easy listening, but somehow manage to be both faithful to their traditions and utterly convincing underground pop. It’s not maximum distortion all the way though: ‘Brovi’ sounds like a Balkan Mantronix with its rolling 90s groove, and the jazzy ‘Dođi Mali’ could be late Roy Ayers holidaying on the Black Sea. 
It won’t be for everyone, but with this much energy you can imagine them blowing everything else clean off the site at WOMAD.

This newly packaged “Best Of” brings together hits from his extensive catalogue of film soundtrack work and export-minded solo albums over the last twenty years. Bregovic’s genius lies in being able to make potentially alien music instantly accessible: songs like ‘In the Death Car’ with Iggy Pop, all drawling, laconic vocal over a chugging Balkan trumpet groove and the theatrical naïve-funk of ‘Man From Reno’ with Scott Walker are unlikely collaborations to say the least, but Bregovic pulls them off with utter style. The soundtrack hits are all present and correct: his anthemic reinventions of ‘Mesecina’, ‘Ederlezi’ and the lush tango ‘Ausencia’ with Cesaria Evora undoubted highlights that still sound fresh after all these years. Overall a good introduction to the man and his music.

The result is a bit of a mixed bag: the collision of Central Asian singers and instrumentalists and cranked up FX units works very well on tracks like ‘Pagansonic’ with its blissed-out vocal sample, but ultimately OMFO’s cleverly sculpted sounds don’t manage to sustain interest over an entire album,. When he ventures into downtempo hip-hop on ‘Windhorse’, the rolling plucked hook works a treat, but elsewhere – for example the laborious ‘Caravanserai’ –  the drum programming gets decidedly patchy, resulting in music that relies too heavily on its concept: you can’t help thinking what effect a few hard-hitting guests with strong songs would have on this heady brew. Overall it’s all a bit achingly trendy – but if you’re not looking for a sonic background to accompany a bar filled with beautiful people or a high-end yoga session, you’ll be ultimately left wanting a lot more focus.

> As the pumping, insistent guitar chords of this album's first track fire up, steadily rising in intensity alongside shouting voices, you don't know whether we're heading for a riotous gig or a pub brawl. What comes out is neither: rather a kind of growling, horn-led rock song over a backbeat that doesn't quite hit the heights promised by its introduction. Nonetheless, it does hint at what Czech world music band Cankisou – on their fourth album after a decade together – are capable of. Second track ‘Zuha’ is more like it: its insistent Archie Shepp-meets-punk-Balkan groove fires away, all the while hinting at the feeling of latent chaos that makes bands like Leningrad and the Betsuni Nanmo Klezmer band so exhilarating.  Partially influenced by recent tours taking in Pakistan, Ukraine and La Réunion – this is a confident, tight album with plenty of surprises: ‘Caloudbadia’ rides on a slick Afrobeat groove with squealing clarinet and a singlalong lead vocal by Réunionnais guest singer Byin Maye; ‘Kustino Oro’ is the Balkan standard but with an intriguing edge – part Bollywood big band and part Lalo Schifrin and with a driving punk energy. Lead singer Karel Herman has a theatrical, declamatory kind of voice that sometimes sits awkwardly on top of the harder-edged songs in this combustible mixture - nonetheless Lé La is an adventurous, expansive album that deserves to do very well indeed.

> And so out of the inane cavalcade of Balkanogypsy soundalikes, comes a blow-your-mind original. The Destroyers are a fifteen piece Birmingham, UK based collective with a difference – yes, they have the requisite rip-roaring horns, a crisp rhythm section and a charismatic leader, but they also have songs - yes, songs - with intelligent lyrics and a maturity that far surpasses the usual alcohol-meets-exotica approach. Front man Paul Murphy’s poetic growl sets the mood right away on ‘Utopia Bypass’: his gravelly voice declaiming over a lolloping cimbalom groove, sounding every bit like Taraf de Haidouks wandering by mistake onto the Thriller video shoot. What makes this album stand out is the wealth of ideas: ‘Where Has The Money Gone’ is a rabble-rousing polka narrated by a suicidal Bernard Madoff – but where lazier bands would let that one, good, central idea loose and leave it at that, the Destroyers flit from narrative, funk guitar led verse to hell-for-leather chorus and Celtic interlude without missing a beat. They can do jump-up instrumentals, as on the playfully named, Bulgarian sounding ‘The Stork Crossing the Dudley Canal’, and also choruses with good hooks – the willfully schizophrenic ‘Out Of Babel’ being a prime example. Just when you think everything is clear, another surprise: ‘Torregavata’, a thoroughly feel-good summery Italian waltz with a sublime lead vocal from trumpeter Leo Altarelli, warm Django-style guitar accompaniment and rich, dark lyrics of love and death. Minimum pretence and maximum style: Out Of Babel is a sophisticated, theatrical tour de force.

> There are a few small labels out there digging in the crates for hidden slices of Central and East European funk, ska, jazz and hip-hop: Eastblok, operating out of Berlin, are one who consistently come up with the goods. For this latest compilation, they turn to the Polish drumnbass reggae roots dub scene, and manage to dig up some real gems. The liner notes report that Poland was the only East European country in the 80s with an active reggae scene, although only one record – the brilliant and utterly mad “Twinkle Inna Polish Stylee” by the Twinkle Brothers feat. Tribunie Tutki – ever gained much attention beyond its borders. That record’s expansive On-U-Sound dub-meets-Polish-mountain-village-fiddling soundclash – a studio session rumoured to have been hastily set-up in lieu  of payment for a Twinkle gig – has long been a Polish underground classic, and it’s good to see ‘Pierso Godzina’ featured here. Elsewhere the quality is fairly consistent: DJs and radios will like the catchy vocal hooks and rock-solid ska riffs of opening track ‘Kołomyka Jarocińska’; ‘Kiebyś Ty’ from Zakopower is another storming vocal track - its excellent Seth Lakeman style rhythm fiddling and rousing chorus will be a real find for fans of the Warsaw Village Band, whose remixed track ‘Joint Venture Inna Village’ is a driving, tribal violin-based floor-filler. The compilation is let down in places by forays into cheap-sounding drumnbass, like ‘XXI.Wiek.’ by Masala Soundsystem, but overall there is more than enough here to keep curious listeners happy.

> Dogan Mehmet is a British folk original: a Brighton-born, second generation Turkish Cypriot singer and fiddler, runner up at the 2008 BBC Young Folk Awards, and on a mission to bring his two cultures that little bit closer together. His debut album duly contains a curious mix of English and Turkish traditional folk songs, and some self-penned folk-rock numbers in English. Although it is his punky renditions of English songs – like opening track ‘Wraggle Taggle Gypsies’, with its introduction of eery, autotuned vocals over a brooding, layered violin drone – that are destined to attract most attention, it is not really until the first Turkish-language song that the album starts to shine. ‘Dillirga’, with its soaring crowd-pleasing chorus, is a definite highlight.
Elsewhere there are flashes of the Pogues, Seth Lakeman and even early Klezmatics. A bit more production and mixing polish would have given an extra oomph that is occasionally lacking – but this is a promising start from a talent to watch.

> World music has a killer sales pitch: put on that great new album, close your eyes and let the exotic sounds cast you off to a distant place where only beautiful things happen to nice people. For musicians from less glamorous locales, this can be a problem. The solution – to celebrate inauthenticity in all its glory, and the third album by Slovenian ensemble Fake Orchestra reimagines local folk in lavish Latin, African and jazz arrangements. Opening track ‘Lisička’ is a local children’s song whose melody apparently echoes the title tune from the soundtrack to the classic Brazilian film Black Orpheus: Ana Vipotnik does a superb impression of MPB legend Elis Regina on vocals, and the soaring ‘aaa-aaah’ chorus sounds like a lost tropicalismo gem. So far, so impressive – the musicians are excellent, the arrangement sensitive and authentic. Unfortunately next track ‘Jarabi’, a West African tune with a parallel Slovenian translation, brings us closer to the heart of things. This song, and most of the ones that follow, belong to the dark Latino-Afro-Jazz hybrid genre “cruise ship”, arranged professionally but politely, and recorded and mixed as brightly as the singer’s sequins. Band leader Igor Leonardi is a stalwart of the Slovene avant-garde scene and an old sparring partner of the great Don Cherry, so no doubt there are lashings of subtle irony for a local audience. It is clear that the musicians here are enormously talented, but to these ears Fake Orchestra sounds not so much inauthentic, as downright inoffensive.

Golden Brass Summit
Fiesta Mania

> The Dragacevski Sabor Trubaca – better known to music fans as the Guca festival, after the town in Central Serbia where it takes place every year – has fast become a place of annual pilgrimage for festival goers in search of Europe's best party. The legendary skills of the trumpet players, gathered from every corner of the country and beyond, is reputed to draw crowds of up to 200,000 fans every summer. For the bands, winning a prize in the festival competition – Best Orchestra and Golden Trumpet being the most hotly disputed – is the holy grail of the domestic world music scene, both in terms of reputation and career: Boban Markovic and Slobodan Salijevic are just two of the trumpet stars whose bands first found fame by winning at Guca. 

> Four films on this DVD show the festival, its legendary musicians and crowds in all their glory. Producer and director Ilija Stankovic is a man who knows Guca very well, having filmed at the festival for many years, and this DVD is an accompanying release to the superb double album of Guca archive recordings, Golden Brass Summit, that Stankovic produced for Network Medien back in 2002.  The main film here, Fiesta Mania, is a document of Guca over the past eight years rather than a documentary film – tunes from great bands accompanying fifty four minutes of edited footage from the festival stages, streets and cafes without any narrative, explanation or interpretation. The effect is something like an anthropologist making a video clip – the music is glorious, and scenes of colourful debauchery come and go, mixing professional footage shot on cranes with amateur hand-held shots. For all his good intentions, Stankovic clearly isn’t a film-maker, and you can’t help wondering what a more experienced director and editor would have done with the wealth of material here. Occasionally brilliant live footage can’t hide the fact that Fiesta Mania is a cracking soundtrack with visuals, rather than a film: the playing is sensational, but the images are mundane, fiicking between trumpet players, dancing girls and drunken men with tedious regularity. The other three short films continue in the same frustrating vein.
Great music, but as a film it’s a wasted opportunity – get Network’s fantastic double CD and yourself to the Guca festival instead.

> And so the party goes on. It seems hard to believe that Romanian Gypsy firebrands MRB have only been around for few short years: when they burst onto the scene in 2005 with their self-titled debut album, their slick, hard-dancing sound was an instant hit in clubs and festivals worldwide, even earning them a slot on the Borat soundtrack. A good part of that success must go to producers Henry Ernst and Marc Elsner, who really understand how to balance tight studio production and the loose, live energy of blistering horns, and this long-awaited follow-up is a class affair throughout. After a slightly slow start – the Fanfare Ciocarlia tuneTu Romnie and is good, but a little on the safe side – bandleader Aurel Ionita and arranger Adrian Sical really start to show what they can do. Nu Mai Beau is a fast and furious dancefloor workout with a rock solid uptempo groove, frenetic horn riffs and the punchy Roma scat singing that Romanian singers do so well. Best of the bunch is Ding Deng Dong, written by Belgrade labelmates Kal, which starts with a rolling Manu Chao groove before letting rip into a heavy ska with a gloriously catchy chorus, and Solo Para Ti, a gypsy flamenco meets Balkan horns fiesta is another winning combination of soaring lead vocal and killer rhythmic hook. Resist at your peril.

> Of the many Balkan and Gypsy compilations out there, Robert Soko’s Balkan Beats has always stood out for its wide selection and solid dancefloor credentials, thanks to his longstanding Balkan Beats nights in Berlin where he is resident DJ. It was the first Balkanbeats compilation on top indie label Eastblok that first introduced talents like Slovenian gunslinger Magnifico to a wider international audience. Now in its fourth instalment on new home Piranha, Gypsy Djs will find plenty of floorfillers, although there are more known names and less of Soko’s crate-digging here than usual. Nonetheless there is plenty to keep hips swinging: Dunklebunt’s Cinnamon Girl is a bouncing little dance number that almost could be a remix from Belleville Rendezvous; local ska ragamuffin party kings Rotfront tear it up with typical flair on B-Style; Serbian alt-rave rockers Vrelo bring an almost electro-breakdance synth rhythm to traditional female close-harmony singing on Oj Vrelo. Finally it is the Vera Bila, gypsy rumba sound of joyous Czech outfit Deladap that is the pick of the bunch with Radost. All in all another solid selection from one of world music’s hardest working DJs.

> Boban Markovic, one of European music’s top trumpet players, has been playing explosive Balkan gypsy tunes for longer than almost anyone can remember, certainly long before the whole ‘gypsy remix phenomenon blew up.  With young son Marko now leading the band alongside him, Boban has been chasing that hipper club-produced sound in recent albums, so it is a pleasure to note this return to form. True, it is not yet a pure return to his early days – his exquisitely soft rendition of Izvorski Biseri on Network’s excellent Golden Brass Summit compilation is the undoubted highlight -  but with the exception of the clumsily produced dance-rap tune Sljivovica, Boban and the band are playing with fire in their bellies again. Rromano Biav is a perfect example of the all-horns-blasting, wickedly sinuous, Turkish-inflected cocek groove that has made the Gypsy brass sound such an anthemic dance music in recent years – an ultra-tight, delicious groove that grabs you and just won’t let go. Elsewhere, some top-notch guest vocalists are welcome additions to the party: the Rom pop sound of Soske Sul Na Avea featuring Bulgarian singer Sofi Marinova is one of the best cuts here, with a blistering trumpet solo just in case you forget who’s really in charge. The production is generally solid and young Marko feels more integrated into the band sound than before: he gives the band an added drive and energy, without being allowed to take over the show. Welcome back to one of the best bands in the business.

> And so the Suddeeutsche funkateers are back with a bang. For those listeners who were lucky enough to stumble across last year’s Habedieehre,  it was the shock of the season: a Bavarian five-piece, just three horns, vocals, electric bass and drums, performing their own songs in the local dialect. But what singer Stefan Dettl does with this combination is beyond any expectation: there’s a straight-up pop sensibility as sharp as MGMT or any of the latest alt-electro-pop hyphenates, and with Ubersee, LaBrassBanda might just have delivered the surprise underground hit of the year.  Three things leap out: killer US RnB style grooves and licks, top musicianship and a totally cliché-free approach. It kicks so hard that it really doesn’t matter if you understand the words or not. Opening track Bierzelt sounds like Beyonce opening Oktoberfest; Des Konnst Glam is a swinging blowout with all the funk of 70s legends Brass Construction; Ringlbleame does the same with the added bonus of a hook-laden pop chorus; on Nanana, they show they can also play it as sweet and spiritual as a New Orleans shout band. It’s fresh, confident and totally unlike anything else out there. Get onto this before everyone else does.

> World music compilations tend to fall into two categories: a selection put together with deep knowledge of a particular region or style – or a cheap way for a label to exploit their back catalogue. On first glance, despite the excellent pedigree of German label Network, this feels like the latter: with the exception of French troubadours Bratsch and Roma legend Esma Redžepova, the guest list looks distinctly B-list. Two traditional songs by the Sandy Lopicic Orkestar, an Austrian group of musicians from former Yugoslavia who make up much of Shantel’s backing band these days, are just a warm-up to Esma’s grand entrance, but what an entrance it is. ‘Tu, Me, Duj Dzene’ is a stunning reminder of the power of the one of the greatest voices in music today. Her band sizzle on snaking clarinet, funky hand percussion, accordion, bass and guitar, and Esma struts atop the whole glorious mixture like a Macedonian Aretha Franklin. ‘Elden Ele’ by Turkish masters Istanbul Oriental Ensemble is a swinging, cinematic sweep of percussion and strings with another star turn by a mesmerising clarinet soloist, Savas Zurnaci. ‘Romano Chocheko’, a rare instrumental outing by Esma’s backing band, Ensemble Teodosievski, is every bit the wedding keyboard, accordion and trumpet dance anthem: in the wrong hands it could be a disaster but with players this good, all dodgy synths are forgiven. And from here in the goods keep coming: one of the best Balkan compilations out there from a label with a catalogue of serious riches.

> Several things about this record will make the curious listener well disposed from the off: firstly, despite its rich heritage, little music from Georgia outside its glorious tradition of polyphonic singing has made it onto an international release; second, alongside his Georgian core, guitarist Zaza Miminoshvili has recruited a high calibre band, including the breathtaking Bulgarian kaval flute master, Theodosii Spassov; thirdly, amongst the original compositions and pieces from regional stalwarts like Mikis Theodorakis, the liner notes describe track two, based around the coastal region of Adjara, with the immortal words “it is very hard for a small man in a large city to sell potatoes.” The music, unfortunately, doesn’t quite live up to this tantalising billing, unless what you are looking for is some heavy Weather Report-era jazz fusion alongside your Georgian folk. The playing is of a high standard, but ‘Sharatin’ is a case in point in where things could have gone with a bit more focus: the opening, with the band singing in rich-throated acapella harmonies, sends a shiver down the spine; the meandering fretless bass solo that interrupts it will having you reaching for the remote. Spassov’s own composition ‘Something Wonderful’ confounds this dodgy brew: his breathy kaval soars above the synth pads and bass with great aplomb, showing his masterful control and melodic ear. Acoustic Laz song ‘Gelino’ could be a delicious outtake from Kusturica’s Time of the Gypsies; ‘Temel’ could be the theme tune to Frasier dubbed into Georgian. Approach with care.
