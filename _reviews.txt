Aneinu: Hasidic Orthodox Music from the Festival of the Torah in Jerusalem

*

 > There are two ways to look at klezmer music in Israel: the first, that it has never been much in fashion – most Israelis treat its appearance on TV for Jewish festivals like the Queen’s speech at Xmas, to be tolerated rather than loved; the second, that it has never gone out of fashion, still performed at religious Hasidic functions and feasts much as it has been for many years. Moshe Berlin is one of the best known clarinet players in the celebratory Israeli Hasidic Orthodox tradition, and throughout this live field recording from a jubilant annual Simchat Torah festival in Jerusalem in 1992, his backing band of drums, guitar and keyboard and what sounds like hundreds of Yeshiva students sing wordless nigunim and religious folksongs from across the Jewish world like their lives depend on it. Berlin’s style of klezmer relies a lot less than its US cousins on jazz and adventurous arrangements, and a lot more on the old fashioned values of simple harmony, clearly articulated playing and directness of intent. The playing, however good, is let down by one crucial factor – the quality of the recording, which is awful. It sounds like it was recorded on a pre-historic mobile phone inside a bag under a table, and the effect is like gate-crashing a wedding when the atmosphere is starting to get lairy. Strictly for students and klezmasochists.

> Out of all the myriad bands out there deconstructing and then rebuilding new repertoire out of klezmer and Balkan music, there can be no doubt that the Amsterdam Klezmer Band are one of the most accomplished bands around. Famed for their cooking live shows and ultra-tight horn section, it was 2007’s Remixed album that really set them apart, pairing their dancefloor friendly licks with top DJs and producers, and inviting Yiddish music to let loose in the global gypsy club revolution. Now they are back with Zaraza, their fifth original studio album and the second for ground-breaking label Frankfurt label Essay, and their recipe of new compositions with sparkling clarinet, sax and brass melodies and infectious accordion propelled grooves is as tasty as ever. The ace in their pack is undoubtedly singer Alec Kopyt – an iconic Odessa born raconteur whose early recordings as Poza are essential – and here his trademark sweet, sandpaper voice is on typically fine form, lamenting about life on “Takaj Zhizn,” although on the intricate Balkan-sounding “Gde”, the vocals feel like something of an afterthought, as Kopyt’s voice isn’t allowed enough space to shine above the densely layered instrumentation. Alongside a plethora of action-packed instrumentals, the best track on the album is “Op Een Goppe” in Dutch – I have no idea what it means, but the rhythm of the language works a treat, somehow giving the band a lighter, more organic feel. All in all, another solid, impressive release from one of the best in the business.

> With no bass and no out and out lead singer, Boom Pam have a unique signature sound: just two guitars, tuba and drums. This means that the cult Tel Aviv surf mashup four piece have the luxury of being able to take on pretty much anything and have it come out sounding like they own it. Their original source of inspiration, 70s Greek Israeli guitar legend Aris San, is still present, but his trademark oriental surf sound is less central to this, their second studio outing. They obviously still enjoy crunching up the Balkan wedding-style repertoire material (“Krai Dunavsko”) that played a big role in their eponymous debut, but on Puerto Rican Nights they cast the net wider, taking in US cult guitarman Dick Dale (“The Wedge”), Spanish movie soundtracks (“Ay Carmela”) and covers of classic old Israeli songs (“Shayeret Harohvim”). Man of the moment, Balkan Beat Box frontman Tomer Yosef, swaggers in to deliver a surefire radio hit in the shape of “Ani Rotse Lazuz” (I Want To Move), which is a grinding “hands in the air” dancefloor gem. Overall it’s a quirky, loveable kind of record more than an obviously commercial one, but for a band with this much personality and humour, there’s no telling where they could go if they really put their mind to it.

> Continuing on from their excellent recent releases, Berlin label Eastblok are back with another delicious find, this time from Milano, Italy. Fez Club play what can only be lovingly described as bastard music here on their third studio album Figli Di Madre Ignota (Sons of Unknown Mothers) –a wild concoction of  klezmer, balkan, spaghetti western, brass and rock. With its thousands of kilometres of coastline facing Spain, the Balkans and North Africa, Italy has a distinguished history of absorbing sounds from elsewhere, chewing them up and spitting them out again in a unique, organic way. One of the most delightful brass records of the past few years came not from the Balkans, but from Italy, courtesy of Sicily’s Banda Ionica, and the good news is that trumpet maestro Roy Paci is also on production duties here. The references are too many to cover in a short review, but standout tracks include Theme from Paradise, a groovy, kitschy number in English with sparkling mariachi horns, the Tom Waits-ish circus vibe of Sadoman with its snarling bass clarinet, and the Slavic ska-punk party thrashout Ole Ole. Highly recommended.

*****

> Reprezent is the second album from the man who is fast becoming the greatest Czech musical export since Dvořák and Janáček, and even for newcomers, the instant appeal of Radoslav ‘Gipsy’ Banga is not hard to fathom: driving upbeat Roma instrumentation, incisive lyrics and fluid vocal delivery, all combined with plenty of tongue in cheek hip-hop swagger. Where much European hip-hop fails due to its aspiration to be nothing more than a pale imitation of its American heroes, Gipsy.cz defiantly bucks the trend: yes, he can’t resist occasional gangsta clichés of posturing, money and bitches, but when a musician can combine the sun-drenched good vibes of rumba diva Věra Bílá (“Benga Beating”) with devastating one-liners about overcoming racism in Czech society (“Barvolepej Svet”, Colour-Blind World), you just have to sit up and take notice. Alongside the sharp lyrical delivery, bouncing guitar and accordion rhythm sections, are plenty of catchy vocal hooks, and Banga is no slouch at singing either. The whole package is so good that even the rapping in dodgy English is somehow convincing. Overall, a record that is both great world music and first rate pop in the best sense of the word.

***

> Asphalt Tango, home to many fine Balkan and Gypsy releases including the wonderful series Classics From a Bygone Era, have always tried to push the boundaries of modern styles. Austrian based collective La Cherga, largely made up of musicians from former Yugoslavia, is an interesting addition to the roster: mostly 90s Everything But The Girl style electronica plus trumpet, saxophone and accordion licks a la Balkan Beat Box, and laid-back English vocals from singer Inna Karamarkovic doing her best Dido impression. It’s the kind of record that works best at a bar in the background: pleasing melodies, good dubby grooves and a lead vocal that is always easy on the ear. When you listen closer though, cracks begin to appear: the acoustic instruments lack punch, the drum programming is not always as crisp as it should be and if the lyrics – eg “This groove always makes you stupid, let your hips just move so freely” – are meant to be ironic, the joke has got lost somewhere in translation. La Cherga try hard to go beyond the Balkan stereotypes, but they are at their most convincing when they do just that, for example on the headbanging, four to the floor, trumpet ska of Rembetiko. “We are going nowhere,” sings Inna Karamarkovic repeatedly on opening track Cooking Dub comes to a close. Well, I wouldn’t have put it so harshly myself, but she has a point: overall this is a promising but incomplete debut from a good band in need of a sharp pair of digital scissors.

> The Balkan scene in Vienna has been quietly cooking away for some years now: first local DJ Ulf Lindemann aka Dunkelbunt worked with everyone from Fanfare Ciocarlia to the Amsterdam Klezmer Band and set dancefloors alight at his Balkan Hot Step nights; Binder and Krieglstein with their quirky klezmer inflected sub-pop, and now the debut record of Czech/Macedonian DJ Ahilea. Most of the album is not bass-heavy club anthems, but lighter, more obviously swinging mid-tempo grooves: plenty of chopped up guitar and accordion chops alongside tapan drum rhythms to keep things chugging along nicely. While the largely instrumental grooves tend to be understated, there are plenty of thrilling, snaking solos from a stylish cross-Balkan émigré band: on ‘Kalabalak’, Turkish Macedonian clarinet player  Hidan Mamudov sounds every bit as commanding as the great Selim Sesler, and accordion player Mitke Sarlandziev on opening track ‘Café Svetlana’ sounds like he could go on conjuring up those lithe, meandering melodies all night. There’s nothing groundbreaking here, and it’s not the kind of record that will crash its way into the mainstream, but there’s plenty of subtle quality here to keep Balkanheads quietly nodding in approval.

*****

> Israel has for years been home to a number of masterful exponents of traditional Arabic, Turkish and Persian instruments such as ud, ney and saz, who, through interplay with both Eastern and Western art musics and the many local folk and Jewish liturgical traditions, manage to create a dynamic scene that sounds quite unlike any of its neighbours. Step up Amir Perelman, a cello and Turkish bouzouk player, whose New Song Of Jerusalem Ensemble’s debut album gets its first international release here. The instrumentation of the ensemble – violin, cello, bouzouk, piano, clarinet and percussion – is designed expressly to float between genres, coaxing out lush textures while taking in associations from Satie to Oum Kalsoum to Hasidic wordless nigun songs. Much like Tunisian oud player Anouar Brahem, it is the sheer beauty and space in the arrangements that gets you here. ‘Ya’ala Ya’ala’ is a case in point: starting out with just bouzouk and percussion playing the simple melody over Ofir Tal’s repeated piano drone, the theme is developed with increasing intricacy until the ecstatic solo section, where violinist Oren Tsor unfurls spectacularly over the hypnotic rhythmic drone like a peacock. The pace is not all stately explorations of mood: ‘The 5th Tov U Meitiv’ is a partly clarinet-driven tango,  and ‘Hushi’ is more an uptempo Eastern jazz workout. But it is on the more meditative, spiritual numbers that this band really excel. A record to make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck.

> UK based Israeli bassist Daphna Sadeh has been making music at the frontline of jazz and Jewish music for many years, and in this, her third full length album and first on John Zorn’s pioneering Tzadik label, it sounds as though she has finally found a home worthy of her talents: this must be one of the most approachable and swinging releases in the whole catablogue. Granted, there is nothing groundbreaking in her cherry-picking of Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Arabic traditions, but you can tell she has spent time bringing together a band who really bring out the best in each other. On the first track ‘Queen of Sheba’, Eddie Hession’s light-fingered accordion opens the record with a jaunty step that stays with you throughout; multi-talented clarinettist Stewart Curtis has been in many bands over the years, but has never sounded better, letting rip on the delicate arrangement of the liturgical song ‘Avinu’ with a flair that would put much bigger US names to shame. Every one of her compositions sings, and percussionist Ronen Kozokaro, guitarist Ivor Goldberg and trombonist Mark Bassey form a tight unit that never misses a beat. In this passionate, highly accessible record, Sadeh has obviously found her voice as a stylish composer and bandleader with a talent for making the complicated sound extraordinarily simple. Recommended.

****

> Since their original gypsy compilation back in 1999, Rough Guide to the Music of the Gypsies, enough has gone on in terms of public perception to warrant a slew of more specialised compilations – the Music of Hungarian Gypsies, Balkan Gypsies and Romanian Gypsies. Now, as Rough Guides pan out with this second edition to take stock of the whole scene, it is clearly popular enough to have evolved into a genre in its own right: gypsy music. So where to start? All the big Balkan names are rightly here: Romanian brass band Fanfare de Ciocarlia kick us off with ‘Que Dolor’, their storming Spanish language version of their first hit ‘Iag Bari’; Taraf de Haidouks’ interpretation of Khachaturyan’s ‘Waltz from Masquerade’ shows them at their sublime best; the thrashed out, over-produced ‘Guglo Kafava’ doesn’t do Bosnia’s Mostar Sevdah Reunion justice at all. Alongside the excellent buleria ‘Un Compromiso/Toda Una Vida’ by gutsy flamenco revivalists Son De La Frontera, and Stochelo Rosenberg’s gypsy jazz Stevie Wonder cover ‘I Wish’ are a few stranger choices:!Dela Dap’s electro pop would be better served by separate album as it sits awkwardly in this acoustic mix, as does ‘Barish’ from Rajasthani band Musafir, an afterthought tacked on at the end. Three stars for the album itself, one more for the gritty, impressive bonus CD: a whole album by Hungarian Bela Lakatos, which is well worth the cover price alone.

> It had to happen sooner or later: the coming together of Serbia’s two great musical loves, monophonic folk and monolithic rock under the same musical roof. But before you reach for the industrial strength earplugs and rakija, some background. Vrelo was founded in 1999 as a folk ensemble with eighteen female singers and seven traditional musicians performing Serbian ritual songs. Not musically unlike its much better known cousin Bulgarian folk singing, as practised so wonderfully by groups like Les Mysteres des Voix Bulgares and Trio Bulgarka, Serbian close vocal harmony songs as sung accapella by Vrelo – now an eight piece with bass and drums – is every bit as spine-tingling. Their subsequent evolution in 2003 into a speaker shattering rock and electronic folk outfit is not as scary as it sounds: tracks like the opener ‘Karavilje Lale’, and ‘Teralo Stojne’with their roaring bass and punching syncopated snares under the soaring unison folk song doesn’t make for easy listening, but somehow manage to be both faithful to their traditions and utterly convincing underground pop. It’s not maximum distortion all the way though: ‘Brovi’ sounds like a Balkan Mantronix with its rolling 90s groove, and the jazzy ‘Dođi Mali’ could be late Roy Ayers holidaying on the Black Sea. 
It won’t be for everyone, but with this much energy you can imagine them blowing everything else clean off the site at WOMAD.

> The musical life of Bosnia's prodigal son is a tale of two Gorans: an artful importer of Western rock to hungry local teens in the 70s; then a slick exporter of sparkling Gypsy trumpet-led dance music and melancholy voices to an equally hungry Europe in the 90s. This newly packaged “Best Of” brings together hits from his extensive catalogue of film soundtrack work and export-minded solo albums over the last twenty years. Bregovic’s genius lies in being able to make potentially alien music instantly accessible: songs like ‘In the Death Car’ with Iggy Pop, all drawling, laconic vocal over a chugging Balkan trumpet groove and the theatrical naïve-funk of ‘Man From Reno’ with Scott Walker are unlikely collaborations to say the least, but Bregovic pulls them off with utter style. The soundtrack hits are all present and correct: his anthemic reinventions of ‘Mesecina’, ‘Ederlezi’ and the lush tango ‘Ausencia’ with Cesaria Evora undoubted highlights that still sound fresh after all these years. Overall a good introduction to the man and his music.

> Our Man From Odessa – aka Crimean-born producer German Popov – makes music that feels unlike pretty much anyone else on the world music scene: swirling, dubby instrumental electronic soundscapes that draw as much from Studio One, surf guitar and vintage synths as they do from turbo Romanian pop and – on this album – Tajik folk, a result of an inspirational trip to Tajikistan courtesy of the Aga Khan Music Initiative. The result is a bit of a mixed bag: the collision of Central Asian singers and instrumentalists and cranked up FX units works very well on tracks like ‘Pagansonic’ with its blissed-out vocal sample, but ultimately OMFO’s cleverly sculpted sounds don’t manage to sustain interest over an entire album,. When he ventures into downtempo hip-hop on ‘Windhorse’, the rolling plucked hook works a treat, but elsewhere – for example the laborious ‘Caravanserai’ –  the drum programming gets decidedly patchy, resulting in music that relies too heavily on its concept: you can’t help thinking what effect a few hard-hitting guests with strong songs would have on this heady brew. Overall it’s all a bit achingly trendy – but if you’re not looking for a sonic background to accompany a bar filled with beautiful people or a high-end yoga session, you’ll be ultimately left wanting a lot more focus.

> As the pumping, insistent guitar chords of this album's first track fire up, steadily rising in intensity alongside shouting voices, you don't know whether we're heading for a riotous gig or a pub brawl. What comes out is neither: rather a kind of growling, horn-led rock song over a backbeat that doesn't quite hit the heights promised by its introduction. Nonetheless, it does hint at what Czech world music band Cankisou – on their fourth album after a decade together – are capable of. Second track ‘Zuha’ is more like it: its insistent Archie Shepp-meets-punk-Balkan groove fires away, all the while hinting at the feeling of latent chaos that makes bands like Leningrad and the Betsuni Nanmo Klezmer band so exhilarating.  Partially influenced by recent tours taking in Pakistan, Ukraine and La Réunion – this is a confident, tight album with plenty of surprises: ‘Caloudbadia’ rides on a slick Afrobeat groove with squealing clarinet and a singlalong lead vocal by Réunionnais guest singer Byin Maye; ‘Kustino Oro’ is the Balkan standard but with an intriguing edge – part Bollywood big band and part Lalo Schifrin and with a driving punk energy. Lead singer Karel Herman has a theatrical, declamatory kind of voice that sometimes sits awkwardly on top of the harder-edged songs in this combustible mixture - nonetheless Lé La is an adventurous, expansive album that deserves to do very well indeed.

> And so out of the inane cavalcade of Balkanogypsy soundalikes, comes a blow-your-mind original. The Destroyers are a fifteen piece Birmingham, UK based collective with a difference – yes, they have the requisite rip-roaring horns, a crisp rhythm section and a charismatic leader, but they also have songs - yes, songs - with intelligent lyrics and a maturity that far surpasses the usual alcohol-meets-exotica approach. Front man Paul Murphy’s poetic growl sets the mood right away on ‘Utopia Bypass’: his gravelly voice declaiming over a lolloping cimbalom groove, sounding every bit like Taraf de Haidouks wandering by mistake onto the Thriller video shoot. What makes this album stand out is the wealth of ideas: ‘Where Has The Money Gone’ is a rabble-rousing polka narrated by a suicidal Bernard Madoff – but where lazier bands would let that one, good, central idea loose and leave it at that, the Destroyers flit from narrative, funk guitar led verse to hell-for-leather chorus and Celtic interlude without missing a beat. They can do jump-up instrumentals, as on the playfully named, Bulgarian sounding ‘The Stork Crossing the Dudley Canal’, and also choruses with good hooks – the willfully schizophrenic ‘Out Of Babel’ being a prime example. Just when you think everything is clear, another surprise: ‘Torregavata’, a thoroughly feel-good summery Italian waltz with a sublime lead vocal from trumpeter Leo Altarelli, warm Django-style guitar accompaniment and rich, dark lyrics of love and death. Minimum pretence and maximum style: Out Of Babel is a sophisticated, theatrical tour de force.

For this latest compilation, they turn to the Polish drumnbass reggae roots dub scene, and manage to dig up some real gems. The liner notes report that Poland was the only East European country in the 80s with an active reggae scene, although only one record – the brilliant and utterly mad “Twinkle Inna Polish Stylee” by the Twinkle Brothers feat. Tribunie Tutki – ever gained much attention beyond its borders. That record’s expansive On-U-Sound dub-meets-Polish-mountain-village-fiddling soundclash – a studio session rumoured to have been hastily set-up in lieu  of payment for a Twinkle gig – has long been a Polish underground classic, and it’s good to see ‘Pierso Godzina’ featured here. Elsewhere the quality is fairly consistent: DJs and radios will like the catchy vocal hooks and rock-solid ska riffs of opening track ‘Kołomyka Jarocińska’; ‘Kiebyś Ty’ from Zakopower is another storming vocal track - its excellent Seth Lakeman style rhythm fiddling and rousing chorus will be a real find for fans of the Warsaw Village Band, whose remixed track ‘Joint Venture Inna Village’ is a driving, tribal violin-based floor-filler. The compilation is let down in places by forays into cheap-sounding drumnbass, like ‘XXI.Wiek.’ by Masala Soundsystem, but overall there is more than enough here to keep curious listeners happy.

His debut album duly contains a curious mix of English and Turkish traditional folk songs, and some self-penned folk-rock numbers in English. Although it is his punky renditions of English songs – like opening track ‘Wraggle Taggle Gypsies’, with its introduction of eery, autotuned vocals over a brooding, layered violin drone – that are destined to attract most attention, it is not really until the first Turkish-language song that the album starts to shine. ‘Dillirga’, with its soaring crowd-pleasing chorus, is a definite highlight.
Elsewhere there are flashes of the Pogues, Seth Lakeman and even early Klezmatics. A bit more production and mixing polish would have given an extra oomph that is occasionally lacking – but this is a promising start from a talent to watch.

> World music has a killer sales pitch: put on that great new album, close your eyes and let the exotic sounds cast you off to a distant place where only beautiful things happen to nice people. For musicians from less glamorous locales, this can be a problem. The solution – to celebrate inauthenticity in all its glory, and the third album by Slovenian ensemble Fake Orchestra reimagines local folk in lavish Latin, African and jazz arrangements. Opening track ‘Lisička’ is a local children’s song whose melody apparently echoes the title tune from the soundtrack to the classic Brazilian film Black Orpheus: Ana Vipotnik does a superb impression of MPB legend Elis Regina on vocals, and the soaring ‘aaa-aaah’ chorus sounds like a lost tropicalismo gem. So far, so impressive – the musicians are excellent, the arrangement sensitive and authentic. Unfortunately next track ‘Jarabi’, a West African tune with a parallel Slovenian translation, brings us closer to the heart of things. This song, and most of the ones that follow, belong to the dark Latino-Afro-Jazz hybrid genre “cruise ship”, arranged professionally but politely, and recorded and mixed as brightly as the singer’s sequins. Band leader Igor Leonardi is a stalwart of the Slovene avant-garde scene and an old sparring partner of the great Don Cherry, so no doubt there are lashings of subtle irony for a local audience. It is clear that the musicians here are enormously talented, but to these ears Fake Orchestra sounds not so much inauthentic, as downright inoffensive.

It seems hard to believe that Romanian Gypsy firebrands MRB have only been around for few short years: when they burst onto the scene in 2005 with their self-titled debut album, their slick, hard-dancing sound was an instant hit in clubs and festivals worldwide, even earning them a slot on the Borat soundtrack. A good part of that success must go to producers Henry Ernst and Marc Elsner, who really understand how to balance tight studio production and the loose, live energy of blistering horns, and this long-awaited follow-up is a class affair throughout. After a slightly slow start – the Fanfare Ciocarlia tuneTu Romnie and is good, but a little on the safe side – bandleader Aurel Ionita and arranger Adrian Sical really start to show what they can do. Nu Mai Beau is a fast and furious dancefloor workout with a rock solid uptempo groove, frenetic horn riffs and the punchy Roma scat singing that Romanian singers do so well. Best of the bunch is Ding Deng Dong, written by Belgrade labelmates Kal, which starts with a rolling Manu Chao groove before letting rip into a heavy ska with a gloriously catchy chorus, and Solo Para Ti, a gypsy flamenco meets Balkan horns fiesta is another winning combination of soaring lead vocal and killer rhythmic hook.

Nonetheless there is plenty to keep hips swinging: Dunklebunt’s Cinnamon Girl is a bouncing little dance number that almost could be a remix from Belleville Rendezvous; local ska ragamuffin party kings Rotfront tear it up with typical flair on B-Style; Serbian alt-rave rockers Vrelo bring an almost electro-breakdance synth rhythm to traditional female close-harmony singing on Oj Vrelo. Finally it is the Vera Bila, gypsy rumba sound of joyous Czech outfit Deladap that is the pick of the bunch with Radost. All in all another solid selection from one of world music’s hardest working DJs.
