                <title>Watch</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;Leah’s intensely personal radio portrait of her father’s Alzheimers was one of the most moving projects I’ve been involved in, and even though the music was written over a short period in 2004, Leah’s words continue to resonate with me to this day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the original radio play, ‘Watch’ was reborn as a film, and was nominated for an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ahrc.ac.uk/newsevents/news/rifaceremony/&quot;&gt;AHRC Inspiration Award – Best film inspired by arts and humanities research&lt;/a&gt; in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Blurb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique and creative collaboration between spoken word poet Leah Thorn and filmmaker Ewan Golder, ‘watch’ uses Super 8 film, poetry, storytelling and photography to reveal the centrality of memory to identity and the impact of dementia on a father/daughter relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a haunting original soundscape by Lemez Lovas and Moshik Kop, ‘watch’ is a deeply personal and moving film exploring loss, vulnerability, survival and memorialisation.
The production was made possible by a Leverhulme Trust Artist Residency in the Kent Academic Primary Care Unit at the University of Kent and the England Centre for Practice Development at Canterbury Christ Church University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;About Leah&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leah is a spoken word poet, who works in collaboration with film-makers, dancers and musicians. At the heart of her poetry is the autobiographical exploration of identity and of issues of liberation. She is published through performance, film and anthologies and magazines in England and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leah is currently Leverhulme Trust artist-in-residence in the University of Kent Academic Primary Care Unit and the England Centre for Practice Development at Canterbury Christ Church University. During the residency, Leah will use poetry to explore the life experiences of women in their 60’s.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>World music reviews, guides and sleeve notes</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;I was an in-house reviewer for Songlines magazines for several years, and also wrote for fRoots, The Rough Guide to World Music and others. I liked being up to date with new releases, I got plenty of good music through the post and it kept me in sandwiches while I was writing them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But reviewing other people’s music in print is a terrible thing to do, for three key reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(1) What anyone thinks about a piece of art can change from day to day &lt;br /&gt;
(2) In a small scene like world music, you often have personal relatioships with many of the artists and label owners whose music gets sent to you&lt;br /&gt;
(3) The ratio between how much time artists spend thinking about reviews, and how much time reviewers spend writing them is at least a thousand to one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, like on the Ersatz Musika review below, I really screwed up - not liking the CD on the day it came, and then realising how wonderful it actually was later on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that experience, I graded my reviews on one thing alone - how geniune I thought the release was. If it felt like a labour of love, no matter what I thought of the actual music, I’d grade it high, and if it felt cynical, I had no mercy. As you can see below, I was generally pretty kind.&lt;/p&gt;

 	I got to invite Iva Bittova. And kiss her afterwards. So everything was alright with the world.
 	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was one of those gigs you dream about. Together with Josephine, my partner in YaD Arts, we proposed a festival of music and culture to the Barbican Centre. They said yes, and I got to invite the greatest artists I had ever met, to be in the same place at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Blurb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London, England – Barbican Centre will present X-Bloc Reunion, May 23-31. It is a revolutionary mix of ethnic and urban music from the former Eastern Bloc. From wild Gypsy Balkan brass, to seductive Silk Road vocals, from Tuvan punk and Russian ska to Bulgarian voices and Czech Electronica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fri 23: Djivan Gasparyan / Alim Qasimov / Sergey Starostin 
The musical gods of Armenia and Azerbaijan perform with Russia’s leading folk singer and musician Sergey Starostin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sun 25: Sui Vesan / Iva Bittova

&lt;p&gt;Sun 25: Leningrad
Moscow’s hippest music export make their first ever trip to London, mixing elements of ska, punk, and jaz with a unique dissident edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mon 26: Eastern Divas – Sainkho / Esma Redžepova / Sevara&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A holy trinity of divas – ethereal seductive and surreal; Tuva’s Sainkho, Sereva, the new voice from Uzbekistan, and Queen of Gypsy singers Esma Redžepova.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mon 26: Yat-Kha – Storm Over Asia
Tuvan punk band Yat-Kha perform a live film soundtrack to Vsevold Pudovkin’s 1928 silent masterpiece Storm Over Asia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thu 29: Koutev Ensemble &amp;amp; Theodosii Spassov
Philip Koutev was the genius behinnd Le Mysèter Voix Bulgares and this group is the forerunner of that tradition and bearer of his name, today. A spectacular show performed with female choir, folk orchestra and innovative Kaval player Theodosii Spassov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fri 30: Mostar Sevdah Reunion &amp;amp; Ljiljana Buttler / Merita Halili
Representing the mulit-ethnic sould of Bosnia, Mostar Sevdah Reunion perform herer with veteran Gypsy sinder Ljiljana Buttler. The show is opened by Albanian star Merita Halili.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Press&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/x-bloc-reunion-barbican-london-106653.html&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea under-lying the Barbican&#39;s X-Bloc Reunion is both simple and inspired: to pull together all the strands of the Soviet empire&#39;s indigenous musics - from the austerely traditional to the most liberated post-punk rock - and let them ferment together in a 10-day festival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Michael Church, Independent
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Telegraph
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;X-Bloc Reunion is a music festival, not a political event, but on the opening night, the volatile and often tragic history of the former Soviet states in the Caspian and Caucasus never seemed far away. It is remarkably brave - putting it mildly - for the Barbican to devote a whole series of concerts to the music of the former eastern bloc, and even more brave to kick off with a show featuring celebrities from Azerbaijan and Armenia, two now-independent countries that were in a state of undeclared war for much of the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Robin Denselow, Guardian
&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

                <title>Commercial Subterfuge with Bar Rafaeli</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;I used to work in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.landfmusic.com&quot;&gt;commercial music studio&lt;/a&gt;. An international campaign for an underwear model came in. My response was this. My good friend and partner Yaniv Fridel, as well as the clients themselves, were persuaded that this was a good idea. It got them a lot of attention: we were promptly taken off the job. Listening back, it marked a highpoint in my relationship with the world of making music to flog crap by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with my erstwhile studio partner Yaniv Fridel, I have had the joy to write two sitcom theme tunes for theatre, both of which give me great joy to listen to because they are so annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first piece was for the wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;Latke children’s show with Tall Stories&lt;/a&gt;, and the second video piece above was written for the short comedy Ephesus-Schmephesus by Laurence Marks &amp;amp; Maurice Gran, directed by Mark Rosenblatt, as part of the Bush Theatre’s Sixty-Six Books, an epic performance cycle featuring over 200 artists from across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I mean, Marks and Gran are the UK’s godfathers of sitcom, and so to write a piece for them, well, how could we refuse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apologies to all listeners in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It ran every two months at West London’s finest sweat-filled basement, the Notting Hill Arts Club, for five years: six hours on a Sunday night of raucous, bonkers subversion, featuring Russian/Gypsy/kulturklash acid Balkan live bands and DJs (including me, Max Reinhardt, Misha Maltsev and Ariadne Arendt’s feline alter-ego &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mixcloud.com/mourrka/blat-deluxe/&quot;&gt;Mourrka&lt;/a&gt;), plus the greatest live art team, consisting of Adrian &amp;amp; Zoe Philpott and Cathy Gale I’ve ever seen anywhere (collectively known as the Friends of Gagarin). They made cabbage races, Trotsky blues recitals, an air balalaika contest, felt bear heads and that’s just the bits I can remember. The club owner even had a baby with someone he met at Gagarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Yaniv Fridel, we wrote music for this directorial debut by Keren Abitan, featuring Lucy Dubinchik.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Blurb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the days of the Israeli withdrawal from the settlements in the Gaza strip, when the residents of the Katif Settlements are uniting to fight for its existence, Ruth, a young teenager from the settlement, is searching for excitement. When Ruth meets Erez, a photojournalist sent to cover the events of the disengagement, she realizes that she doesn’t belong anywhere. “Ruth” is an adolescence story of a young girl living in the most dangerous place in Israel. In a society demanding a united front and common beliefs, Ruth fights to interpret her faith in her own way. It is not a political struggle but the struggle of one girl for the privilege of holding an independent opinion in a social surrounding which strongly embraces a united point of view dictated from above.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>La Palestine - Douze Points?</title>
                <description>
&lt;h3&gt;Blurb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eurovision song contest is the most famous singing competition in the world. Now, Palestine want to join. But the road to Eurovision glory is paved with bureaucratic hurdles
Palestinians hope that inclusion in the contest will; “show the world the real face of Palestine”. But as Palestine is not recognised as a country in its own right, it depends on the full backing of other European countries. As Dr Daibis states; “If we are accepted in the Eurovision, it will be the birth of a new era”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Transcript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel/Palestine - Palestine’s Eurovision Entry - 8 min [8 May 2007]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scene 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:00:02:00- 00:02:02:00 Colour Bars&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:02:02 Picture starts (Press conference in Ramallah)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:02.16:00- 00:02: 54: VO: It started as a television experiment by a few European broadcasters after the second WW but now the ESC is one of the most hotly contested and widely watched shows in the world. But participation has long been open to countries beyond Europe, with singers from North Africa, the Caucasus and Israel flying the flag on stage. Now, the Palestinians want to join too – and it has been announced that in 2008 Palestine will be seeking full participation for the first time in the world’s most famous singing competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: News conference announcing the Palestinian bid for Eurovision (Ramallah); Musicians playing the Eurovision tune on kanoun and hand drum; busy streets in Jerusalem’s Old City; music shops in East and West Jerusalem; posters of Palestinian and Israeli singers; Sabreen concert&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musical Soundtrack: Eurovision tune played on traditional Arabic instruments- canoun and hand drum; Wissam Murad (Palestinian singer) music (traditional/jazz fusion music)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scene 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:03.03:00- 00:03: 24:00 :Rasmus Nielsen, ‘Superflex’- ‘Palestinian Eurovision’ Partner: (Press conference Ramallah) 
‘It’s an incredible moment for the Palestinian music scene as well to present itself on an international scale. So I think from the pint of view of the Eurovision community, we should see this as an important moment for opening up and letting Palestinians participate in an international song competition.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:03:25:00- :00:03:41:00 Said Murad, Composer, Sabreen Association for Artistic Development: 
“It will help showing the real face of Palestinians. Palestinians are a nation, and they have everything like any other nation, and this is what we’re trying to show through music.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:03:42:00 – 00:04:12:00 Dr. Fadia Daibas ,Spokeswoman, Sabreen Association for Artistic Development: 
“Music has always been a central part of Palestinian culture, in the camp, in the village in the city - it has been a way of expressing Palestinians’ opinions, Plestinians’ feelings. Also love music, in weddings, in the debke (national folkdance), where all the dancers hold each other’s hands and they dance to folklore music. This is very common in Palestine. It is also as a way of expressing joy and happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: Speakers (Nielsen at press conference Ramallah, Murad in recording studio East Jerusalem, Daibas in Ramallah hotel); images of Palestinian women dancing at a traditional wedding over part of Dr Daibas interview&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musical soundtrack: Drumming at Palestinian wedding, clapping etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scene 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:04:17:00-00:04:45:00 VO: But the road to Eurovision glory is paved with bureaucratic hurdles. First of all the state TV network – in this case the Palestine Broadcasting Corporation or PBC – must be accepted as an active member of the European Broadcasting Union or EBU – that’s the club of European TV networks that organise the competition. A partner from the Eurovision veterans Denmark, has been enlisted to help with the red tape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals over VO: Musicians on concert stage; singer and engineer in recording studio session, technical equipment&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:04:46:00 – 00:05:12:00 Rasmus Nielsen: ‘Superflex’- ‘Palestinian Eurovision’ Partner: PBC is already an approved participant of the EBU and it is recognised as an national TV channel, and we have applied for an active membership. Whether or not this will be approved we do not know yet – it is an application procedure that we are in the middle of. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scene 4&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:05:14:00- 00:05:18:00 VO: Out on the street, the reaction to the news is surprised, but confident. (visuals of busy street in Jerusalem)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:05:20:00- 00:05:51:00 Two young girls: “ We think that for Palestine to be in the Eurovision contest is a fantastic opportunity. For one I think it gives the interernational communities opportunity to acknowledge Palestine, and the music of Palestine, and also its a good opportunity for Palestinians themselves to be motivated to make their music, which is wonderful, to get it out there and make it international.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:05:52:00- 00:06:05:00 Internet café man: I think the idea to present Palestine is a very nice idea. At least people could know the Palestinian culture, and see what kinds of songs we have. It reflects about people living in Palestine. I think it’s a great idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:06:06:00- 00:06:24:00 Old man in souvenir shop: That’s a pride for me, to hear and to know that Palestine will join this contest, and we hope that they will get a real good place in the result, if not the best, at least one of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:06:25:00- 00:06: 45:00 Man 1 in Old City shop: Long time ago Palestine was in a very good situation, we were making good kind of music, good kind of dancing, debke, you know whats debke? All these kinds of things which were traditional. But now we don’t have it that much. You know, its politics , we don’t have such a good mood for it. But maybe one day we’ll have a good life, we’ll have a peaceful life, so we’ll go back as we used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:06:46:00- 00:06:50:00 Man 2 in Old City shop: It would be so nice if Palestine won the Eurovision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scene 5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:06:52:00- 00:07: 15: 00 VO: There are numerous potential obstacles in the way. Firstly – that Palestine is not yet recognised as a country in its own right. But one thing is sure - if they do manage to get accepted for competition in Eurovision 2008, the organisers believe it could help to persuade the world that Palestinians have much more to say than the terrible pictures that we see in the news. ( Visuals- Musicians and singers in live concert)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:07:18:00- 00:07:35:00 Dr Fadia Daibas, Spokeswoman, Sabreen Association for Artistic Development: “ If we are accepted in the Eurovision, and Palestine is also winning the Eurovision competition that would be a very important, a very significant day for all Palestinians all over the world. It will mean a birth of a new era for all Palestinians in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:07:36:00 2 young girls: La Palestine, deuze point!&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Kharkov Klezmer Band</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to be at independent Ukraine’s first klezmer festival - after an 80 year hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was like an emotional coming-out - many small groups across the country had been playing, often in secret, and they were stunned to know that they were part of a larger community, and a larger cultural revival that, having started in the US in the late 70s, was going to give them a firm badge of cultural identity that really belonged to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a beautiful experience, not least because the quality of music was so good - from the KKB - a young, feisty band from Eastern Ukraine who played the traditional style much better than I’d ever heard before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I managed to get them to the UK for workshops, and there we recorded their first album, the whole thing in one take. It still ranks as one of the best old-school klezmer records out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Liner Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The international klezmer “revival” takes many different paths. Indeed it is not really appropriate to refer to it as “revival”, as it suggests that klezmer died and has been “brought back to life”, but this is clearly untrue. For instance, in America, the music never died, but it did lose popularity and underwent many changes. It is only in the past three decades that musicians have repopularised and fed a need from within the culture to listen again to the music from “the old world”. But also in the old world, klezmer gained increasing popularity, even in Eastern Europe after the communist era. As it matures in Russia, klezmer begins to make the club scene. Long before the dark shadows of the 1930s, traditional Jewish celebratory music ‘klezmer’ was a thriving part of everyday life in Jewish communities across the Ukraine. Now those times are long gone, but the rebirth of Jewish communities in Central and Eastern Europe over the last ten years is creating a cultural impetus that is being felt far and wide across the whole region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A video of a klezmer show altered Stanislav Raiko’s career. The Ukrainian born violinist and leader of the Kharkov Klezmer Band recalls: “I just saw this one single show and realized that this was my music and I wanted to play it”. He then began listening to old recordings of Eastern European Jewish folk music to help him master the genre. In the late 1990’s, Raiko, a classically trained musician, started his group The Kharkov Klezmer Band is something new in the international klezmer revival. Like many of the superstar klezmer groups from the USA, they are a group of conservatory educated musicians with flawless technique. But it is the spirit of their music, the profound feeling of what this music means to them and the way they convey this to their audience that makes them truly special. Remember that to perform Jewish music was effectively forbidden in the Ukraine from the 1930s until 1991, and it becomes clearer that this album is more than just a musical statement, it’s the sound of people reconnecting with their heritage, proclaiming their identity after more than half of century of silence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their style of klezmer is raw and beautiful, Jewish music with a deep understanding of its own roots. Traditionally, the goal of the klezmer musician was to bring out both extremes of emotion that a wedding encapsulates: the joy of starting a new family and the sadness of leaving the childhood home. The Kharkov Band can genuinely be said to be one of the few bands on the international circuit who understand this concept of ‘laughter through tears’. Not for nothing have performances across Russia, the Ukraine, Estonia, Hungary, Spain, Austria and the UK fast given them a reputation as one of the most powerful and exciting live acts in Jewish music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lemez Lovas, October 2002&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Press&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alles in allem ein großartiges Klezmeralbum mit weinender Geige und Klarinette, rhythmischem Akkordeon und Perkussion, und es bleibt nur noch in den Text von “A Glezele Lekhaim” einzustimmen: Let’s raise a glass of cheer now!&lt;em&gt;folkworld.eu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Forbidden Games</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;A short report on video games and propaganda in the Middle East. The terribly serious tone seems a bit dated now, but this was a fascinating report to make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more background on games and propaganda in context, see this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/18/video-games-propaganda-tools-military&quot;&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;  article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Full Transcript&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideological gaming in the Middle East&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Report by DigressMedia, Jerusalem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporter intro to camera:  Space Invaders. Super Mario Brothers. Sonic the Hedgehog. Videogames have come a long way since those innocent days. Now with a global market worth billions of dollars annually, games creators have come to realise that this can be more than mere entertainment. Videogames have now become the latest ideological weapon in the battle for young hearts and minds&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: action from US war game. US soldiers corner a single Arab fighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voiceover: Video games are a multi-billion dollar industry. And in the very popular war games, a common scenario turns the player into an imaginary US soldier shooting down groups of Arab terrorists. But there’s a digital backlash brewing in the Middle East, where programmers are creating games from the opposite perspective. (Visuals: Galit Elat teaching child to play) Galit Elat is the director of the Israel Centre for Digital Art. Her exhibition “Forbidden Games” brings together videogames from radically different ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galit Elat: Most of the games are developed with the West’s perspective. So the terrorists are always Arabs, the bad guys are Arabs, the good guys are American or European or Israelis. And they’ve developed different games so that children can identify themselves with heroes that are Arabs, and not Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V/O:  The most violent games are to be found in the bomb shelter underneath the building. The Night of Bush Capturing is a direct adaptation of an American game called the Quest for Saddam. The player takes on the role of an Arab fighter entering a US military camp, shooting American soldiers, and attempting to capture President Bush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: Galit Elat going downstairs to bomb shelter, walking through dark corridors, playing game in darkness, action from the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galit Elat playing game: I’m killing Americans. And I think I’m part of Al Qaeda forces. I’m more interested in the ideological aspect behind the games and less about the experience of playing the games themselves. This is the reason the games are here. Oh someone killed me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: end of game: “You got killed. Do you want to try again? Yes/No.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V/O: Special Force is a game developed by Hezbollah. It begins with a training camp, where players practise shooting on the portraits of Israeli leaders. Then they go out and fight Israeli soldiers in South Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: opening title sequence from Special Force. Shooting practice at head of former Israeli defence minister.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galit Elat playing game: From what I heard it’s a big hit in Ramallah. A lot of young people playing this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: Galit Elat teaching children to play, action from game, child playing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galit Elat: I’m not for these games. For me they are forbidden. But still I open it to the public because one can’t find part of the games here on the market. One has to explore Ramallah or other places, to have other sources to get the games. So in a way I open up something that I think is forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: action from Stone Throwers game - Palestinian demonstrator in front of Al Aqsa Mosque throwing stones at Israeli soldiers and then dying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V/O: One room contains two very different perspectives on the Palestinian Uprising or Intifada. A game from Syria, called The Stone Throwers, centres on a lone Palestinian demonstrator who throws stones at waves of Israeli soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: closing screens from Stone Throwers game. “Game Over. Well maybe you have killed some of the Israeli soldiers in the computer world, but… (photo of martyr’s funeral) This is the real world”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;V/O: On the other hand… a game from Israel called Intifada shows a single Israeli soldier facing many Palestinian demonstrators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: blonde girl playing. Action from Intifada game. Israeli ambulance picks up wounded soldier. “Game Over - you are just another victim of Arab terrorism.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galit Elat: If you think how easy it is to push the button. When you are sitting in a tank, or in an aeroplane. How easy it is to push the button to shoot someone through the screen. I think it’s almost the same feeling as you have here. You don’t communicate. You don’t see face, you don’t see eyes. You just push the button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: computer game - bombing a busy market town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galit Elat: If we want to live in the Middle East we have to communicate with our neighbours and to understand the culture and the motivation, and to have a more if not open environment at least more understanding. That is what we are trying to do as a cultural centre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporter to camera: A games war is being played out on computer screens all over the world. As the games designers compete with eachother a young generation is spending hours in front of the screen. It may look like child’s play but this media war is no game.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>
&lt;p&gt;Yonatan Mizrahi is an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.btselem.org/jerusalem/201012_guardian_project_yonathan_mizrahi&quot;&gt;archaeologist activist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 		&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;sideimage&quot; title=&quot;Click to enlarge&quot; src=&quot;/assets/themes/tufte/images/yoni.jpg&quot; /&gt;

 		&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He didn’t used to care much about politics, but in his role as chief archaeologist for the separation wall that Israel built to limit access into and out of the West Bank, he came to understand that in Israel, archaeology is politics, and that archaeology gives a narrative that can be used to drive political goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the only way that the wall could be stopped, either temporarily, or indefinitely, was through an archaeological discovery. Palestinian landowners whose land was to be appropriate for the wall begged him to “find something, anything”. He realised that he too wanted desperately to “find something” in every back yard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He resigned to set up &lt;a href=&quot;http://alt-arch.org/en/&quot;&gt;Emeq Shave&lt;/a&gt;, or Common Ground, an NGO that represents a non-partisan, apolitical archeological history of Jerusalem, and fights the revisionist-settler movement and its use of archaeology as propaganda. The Palestinian village of Silwan, just outside the Old City walls, is at the forefront of this battle between narrative and reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This film tells its story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Blurb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living with King David is no fun. Just ask the people of Silwan, a Palestinian village just outside the walls of the Old City of Jerusalem. Since the first excavations began in the mid 19th century, archaeologists have come to this picturesque village, spade in hand, hunting for the legendary biblical city of King David. But in the last ten years, this obsession with antiquities risks ruining the lives of the people who live here as a constant threat of demolition hovers over their homes. Is the past more important than the present? Or is there another agenda - something more sinister than an innocent love of history - hidden amongst the stones?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel/Palestine - Digging for Trouble - 23 min 15 sec [14 January 2008]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digging for Trouble&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time-coded script of the final cut (23:44 min)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1: Exterior - archaeological site&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montage with music - excavations at an ancient site, people digging in soft early morning light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rafael Greenberg (Rafi) sweeps ancient stone road and says in Hebrew:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:28:20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sweeping a 5,000 years old road really does it for me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;00:35:24            Voice over during visuals of Rafi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dr Raphael Greenberg, a professor at Tel Aviv University, is one of the Israeli most respected archaeologists. These days Dr Greenberg is a worried man.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2: Exterior - antiquities in the City of David Nat. Park&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title of the film: DIGGING FOR TROUBLE appears during the drive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Driving through a Palestinian village, suddenly the walls of the Old City (with Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa visible) appear in the distance above. Shot of a busy road with the Old city walls in the background and Temple Mount above, CU sign in 3 languages points to the City of David. (music)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VO over the following visuals: people walk above ancient tower, antiquities, man in “Indiana Jones” hat points to ancient stones, religious man reads book, kids run on ancient walls, ELS people under layers of ancient walls, full view of Silwan village under TM, CU of the Al Aqsa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;01:19:09            VO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“4000 years ago, the heart of ancient Jerusalem, was here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was first discovered by the British explorer Charles Warren in the mid 19th c, and since then the search for biblical CoD has fired the imagination of many archaeologists. Today, these impressive antiquities sit in a disputed area of Jerusalem, inside the Palestinian village of Silwan, captured by Israel in 1967 war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3: Exterior - Pool of Shiloam in CoD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: CU of the Al Aqsa, MS of church surrounded by old houses, glass mosque in front of densely built houses, Rafi Greenberg talks to a group of people, he walks and people follow him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;01:51:06            VO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In such a sensitive place, which stories are told and who tells them can have profound impact on the people who live there. This is what is worrying Dr. Greenberg and he takes his fellow academics around the CoD excavations to explain the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi talks to a group of academics sitting around him at the ancient pool surrounded by stone walls. (in Hebrew)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;02:21:07&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I started my archeological career in Jerusalem, in the City of David excavations in 1978 - 82. During that time I got to know the area really well. I also met my wife here, she is still my wife and I have a very personal and meaningful relation to this place.  Afterwards I became a lecturer at the TA University. In 2002 I came here to prepare a tour for my students, and to my amazement I discovered that the place I knew changed completely. The place I knew as an Arab village with archaeology, turned into a place with armed guards, with guns ready to be pulled out any moment, a place with amplified symbols of Israeli presence - huge flags, watchtowers, cameras filming 24 hours a day. This was my renewed acquaintance with Jerusalem, with the City of David under the rule of Elad, the settler organization that runs the archeological site here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4: Exterior - City of David archaeological park&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: the entrance to the CoD archaeological park, many tourists and soldiers coming in and out, woman playing harp, young women sift through findings and clean them, woman in a hat looks at the view. All over this sequence, there is harp music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doron Spielman, spokesperson of ELAD / Ir David Foundation, walks up the steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;03:55:03            VO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For the last 10 years, the City of David national park has been run by a private foundation called ELAD or Ir David. Doron Spielman is their director of development.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doron talks standing on top of the CoD with the Temple Mount in the background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;04:09:15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Ir David foundation protects what is perhaps maybe the holiest place in the world, or certainly one of the most historical places in the entire world. And we’re standing at no better place in understanding the history of 3 religions in the world today. Here behind me we see the well known Temple Mount, place where originally king Solomon built his Temple 3,000 yrs ago,  today we can see the Al Aqsa mosque standing on top of the Temple Mount,. And we are now in the cradle of civilisation for Jerusalem. A place where 3,000 yrs ago King David came in his attempt to conquer Jerusalem.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: kids playing on rooftops of Silwan houses, tourists looking at the CoD, kids entering ruins, antiquities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CU of Doron talking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;04:45:15&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In this location, the Bible is the most accurate text in understanding the life of the city. In fact, 60% of the Bible was written on this little hill, which is only 150 m wide, by 700m long. Every layer, every stone you pull up and you look at the other side of the stone; you can find a clue to a past civilisation. So this place is so rich in archaeology is that of course that’s what draws everybody to get closer, and closer, to pile on top of home, to be closer to the energy of this place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5: Exterior - Silwan, at the locked entrance to ancient Pool&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shot of an ancient water pool through closed gates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi in front of a closed gate, talks to a guard inside a booth (in Hebrew).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;05:24:16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard: I have instructions not to let any photographers in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi: Not to let photographers in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard: Only from the ELAD organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi; Is this ELAD’s property?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard: Sure, this is private property of ELAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi: I don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard: This is private property of ELAD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi: It seems to me you’re wrong. I think it’s a public area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard: this is private property of ELAD. ELAD invested money here, not the state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi: Do you think there is a difference between ELAD and the state?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard: Yes, there is. ELAD is the only one, for now, who takes care of the site. The state didn’t give any money for this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi: Doesn’t the state give any money to ELAD?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard: Not even a shekel…(camera moves to film the guard) Excuse me, why are you filming? (smiling)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi: Because it interests her. I think this excavations area is public area. It was always public. There used to be a passage here. Then they made excavations here and called them rescue excavations as they said they had to repair the sewage system here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard: The sewage exploded here and then they discovered the pool here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi: It belongs to ELAD?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard: Sure, ELAD paid for all this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi: Ok. So this belongs to ELAD. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shot of a lock over closed gate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6: Exterior - street in the village of Silwan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi Greenberg walks through Silwan, passing by densely built area. Man has a haircut in barber shop, elder man stands on the street, man sweeps the street, a girl looks from her balcony. (music)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi talks standing on a Silwan street and pointing around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intercuts: shots of ancient tombs underneath densely built houses, closed gate, man with a wheelbarrow walks on ancient walls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;06:59:11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So we have here to our right historical village of Silwan - there are many antiquities interspersed with the modern buildings-we can actually see some parts of the bedrock cliff and the tombs, the ancient tombs that were cut into that cliff, about 700 - 800 BC. And then over on this side is the archaeological park of the City of David.  It’s theoretically open to the public - in practice however, Silwanis, the people living here, have no part in this park, they don’t enter the park, they don’t have any opportunity to see its antiquities or to study them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7: Interior - at the entrance to the Warren Shaft&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doron walks down the steps in the park, opens the gate to a building, walks down iron stairs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;07:59:21 “This is the ancient tunnel that he discovered when he came to Jerusalem in 1867.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doron walks through a concrete tunnel towards the shaft. He speaks on top of the shaft:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;08:11:20  “We’re looking, carved into solid bedrock an opening that goes down into the middle of the earth, underneath the city walls, to the water source. You see the Canaanites the progenitors of the Jebusites, in 1850 BCE, dug this underground shaft, which brought people underneath the city walls to the water. Why is this so fantastic? There are few places in the world where you can stand and say- no question they were here. I can tell you with certainty that David, Solomon, Batsheva, Jeremiah, Isaiah, go through all the prophets and all the kings of the ancient world, perhaps the queen of Sheba, they all stood here and they walk down this very shaft- because this was the only way to gather water from the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doron walks down the steps in the narrow deep shaft:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;09:07:05            “Come on, join the fun!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tourists walk down the shaft and through tunnels. Inside a dark underground chamber, a guide speaks to a group of tourists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;09:16:02            Guide: “Until about 200 years ago, no one had any idea where the City of David is. And that changed in 1860 when a British man came to Israel, his name was Captain Charles Warren. And he came to Israel and he wanted to dig underneath the Temple Mount. And why did he want to dig there? Any ideas?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;09:40:23            A tourist: “Looking for treasure”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;09:42:00            Guide: “Looking for treasures, exactly.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doron inside the shaft, his face lit by eerie orange light:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;09:47:14&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Without a doubt we have experienced the most explosive tourism in the entire country. I think this is due to the fact that just now these incredible archaeological finds which have enormous importance for the entire world have come to light. And the archaeology itself speaks, this is not just the stone, this wall is not just a wall, I’m not touching just the stone here,  I’m touching this stone I can feel the chisel made by the Canaanites as they made this stone, I feel king David’s hand as I put my hand on this stone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8: Exterior - Silwan, background of ancient walls with visitors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: LS of woman and boy walk on the Silwan street with the walls of the Old City overlooking it, Rafi walks in Silwan, CU of the walls of the Old City, tourists view the area from above. (sound of muezzin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi speaks on the street, in front of the fence surrounding the CoD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intercuts: tourists walk around the park, man with a wheelbarrow runs, LS kids play on the ancient walls, sign City of David, guard holding a gun walks in front of the entrance to the CoD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10:33:20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Back in the 70s ad 80s when I excavated here, and afterwards when area began to be developed, it was developed by Jerusalem Municipality as a public park accessible to anyone, and it was supposed to represent part of the mosaic of cultures of Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has happened in recent years is that ELAD settlers group has volunteered to take on the management of the entire archaeological park - they’re not doing this out if kindness or good will but as part of their program to take over and occupy large parts of Silwan and make it Jewish. So they have their own slant on the history of this region- it begins more or less at the time of David and then history ends with the destruction of the 2nd temple only to be renewed with their own settlement history or with early Zionist or the 19th C Jewish settlement. This is the ELAD view, and they are entitled to their view as is everyone in Jerusalem. But what has happened is that the government has handed over the keys metaphorically and physically to the ELAD organization and they now control the entire site, they are using their control of these antiquities to control all of Silwan. So it’s a very highly politicized approach to the way antiquities are excavated and presented and this is what troubles me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9:   Exterior - the village of Silwan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: houses with Israeli flag inside Silwan, Jewish religious man sits on a rock looking around, Arab woman on her veranda with grapes, veiled woman walks down the street with a little girl, house with laundry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:17:02            VO:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, a city plan to enlarge the archaeological park called for demolition of 88 houses here in Silwan. After months of protests by Palestinian, Israeli and international activists, the demolishing order was put on hold, but for many, the threat of losing their house remains real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abed Shaludi talks to a group of activists (in Hebrew), Rafi stands next to him listening:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:38:17&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Listen, we’re sitting on a barrel of explosives here. It can explode at any moment. It’s not good for us, nor for you. Not for my children, nor for yours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:51:16          &lt;br /&gt;
VO:
Abed Shaludi, who lives in Silwan, was one of the leaders of the protest campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10: Exterior - Courtyard of the house of Abed Shaludi in Silwan&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abed Shaludi sits under an olive tree in his courtyard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12:58:12&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They wanted to destroy 100 houses. And the demolishing order we received from the municipality, they said that Silwan is part of a very big site of Jewish history, and King David were here before 1000 yrs ago, and he built his kingdom in Jerusalem, in the Old City, and his garden were in Silwan, because they had a lot of water, in all of the years, and imagine, in a few words down there, they wrote, and that’s why we want to destroy a 100 houses. 1500 people live in these houses, imagine that they want to throw them out because King David were here. He slept here, he ate here - so what?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11: Exterior - the City of David national park&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doron stands on stairs, looking at children running by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13:58:13 “These are Arab children that live here.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He extends his hand to them, but they ignore him and run past him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14:14:21 “Children will be children. Children always stay outside of the political argument.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small boy (arms up, V sign) shouts in Arabic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doron stands on top of COD, Silwan background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14:25:16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So this began the process in 1986 the founding of my foundation, the Ir David foundation, whose goal is to return all this land you see behind me into Jewish hands. And we purchased much of this land for much more than its face value, in order to return much of these assets as possible back to the Jewish people. Today 60-65% of this land is now back in Jewish hands, you have Jews and Arabs living peacefully together, and on the surface of the earth you have the dynamic of Jews and Arabs living together, and underneath their feet you’re exploring history.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Montage of shots of Silwan with music:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palestinian woman walks towards the camera, many CU shots of cameras in various places overlooking the village, Palestinian man repairs his satellite dish on a roof, another camera with an Israeli flag, kids enter ancient pool, many fences on a hill on top of which an Israeli flag is waving in the wind, guard wit a gun walks on a roof of a house, kite flying high in the sky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12: Exterior, under olive tree in courtyard of Abed’s house&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abed sits in his courtyard in the shade of an olive tree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intercuts: Abed’s wife and children in courtyard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15:36:08&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They offered my father half a million dollars. I was a millionaire. I was… But I refused. Before a week ago, I talked to a friend, he told me- you know, this is the opportunity of your life. You know what-this is half a million dollars. It’s a very huge money. Take it man! Anyway, they will throw you out of it… I told him-listen man. I had a very hard life. Before 2 yrs ago I was in house custody, most of the time we didn’t have food to eat, me and my children. And I have an opportunity to make half a million dollars! But why should I do that? The only thing that I have here is my reputation. The money can come and go. I don’t care for the money. The money can come and go…My home, my land, I’ve been born here, I know every inch of this place, every stone…”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abed’s daughter calls him to help her with the bicycle. His wife looks at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16:57:11&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My father and mother rented this house in 1964. I was born in 71. In 1990 we found ourselves in the court against the settlers. We asked ourselves- how that became? We lived here since 1964.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abed’s son listens to him, his daughter passes through the gate of their house on a bicycle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13: Exterior, on steps COD, Silwan background&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doron, densely built houses in the distance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inter-cut: very long tilt up along houses piled on top of each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17:24:08&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The process of buying homes in this area, probably a subject that one needs a PHD to understand it, the nuances and intricacies of buying land here- land here is under Ottoman law, British law, Jordanian law and modern Israeli law. And our process of buying a single home here, we can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars, uncovering the correct certifications, to verify that the owner who has approached us is the correct owner. He himself may not know whether he correctly or incorrectly owns that home.  We’ve been in court many times, we’ve been challenged by orgs like the PA or today Hamas, and we’ve never lost a court case against these homes, never, not even once.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arab house with the Israeli flag waving in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14: Exterior- under olive tree in Abed’s courtyard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abed sits under olive tree:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18:09:21&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I lost the court case against the settlers. And the judge ordered to get me out of the house. And to pay of course 20000 shekels court costs. They didn’t give us a date, they kept it open. That’s what makes me more angry, and I won’t say afraid…You know I have wife and children, I have to take care of them. I don’t want to be caught working in a far away place and find the settlers are braking the house and throwing everything out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15: Exterior - Rafi at an excavations site&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi sits inside ancient ruins:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inter-cuts: Temple Mount (with Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock) with clouds passing above it, Jewish religious man prays walking in front of the Wailing Wall, large group of religious people pose for a photo in CoD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;19:04:16&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Dani Seidman from Ir Amim has a phrase that he uses and he calls it the ‘Thermal map’ of Jerusalem, so the hottest place is the Temple Mt, so the nearer you are to the TM, the nearer you are to the core of Jerusalem and whatever changes you want to make to Jerusalem, you want to make as near as you can to the TM. So Elad are located in an ideal spot just beneath the TM, they view it all the time. And for them, it’s a highly emotional religious experience just being there. So it’s a privilege to live in the COD, to be so close to the TM. And this I think clouds their vision, it doesn’t cloud their vision - it colours their vision of everything else. Everything else becomes instrumental in allowing them to live this close to the TM, to allowing them to pave the way, to prepare the ground for the Third Temple. And archaeology is just viewed by them, someone used the phrase, the Messiah’s ass, so archaeologists are the ‘Messiah’s ass’, if they can move us , if they can carry us a few more steps nearer to conquering the entire area of the TM, so be it, we’ll use them, when they get tired we’ll find someone else.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16: Exterior - Pool of Shiloam&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: Sign: “Archaeological site, no entrance” with a house behind it, shots from excavations in Silwan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi speaks to his fellow academics: (in Hebrew)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intercuts: man digs behind fence, huge deep pit with an ancient wall at its bottom and ladders around - tilt up to modern houses right next to the pit&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;20:25:01&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are things you just don’t do. There are things archaeologists have to consider when they dig in a community. We take a public area and tell people - hands off, this is ours, we’ll tare care of it, so don’t disturb us, we’ll return it after we’re done. What we return is never the same as what we take. We always move things, we take things away, we destroy. Every archeological activity is destructive. Every archeologist should ask himself: before I destroy a site for science, I should ask myself if what I do is ethically justified. Does it benefit people who live here, who entrusted me this place?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17: Exterior - street where Abed lives&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visuals: MS minaret surrounded by houses, LS shot of Silwan houses above the excavations site&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abed stands on the street, in the background stands an armed guard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;21:15:20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A lot of people ask me - why do you hate these people? Why should I love them? What they did to me? What good did they bring me and my children? Why should my children see guards with guns around ? So, w hy should I love them? Why should 50,000 people in Silwan love them? They dream to take my land. I’m staying here, my children will stay here…In spite of that I don’t like the kind of life that they live now, my children, and the kind of raise I have to give them with people like this (he points to the armed guard). But…we’ll be here. 36 years of my life I lived here and my sons will be here, too, I’m sure of it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He looks at his two boys in front of the gate to his house, one of them bicycles away and circles around the armed guard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18: Exterior - on the street of Silwan, outside the archeological site&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rafi speaks to his fellow academics, tourists pass by: (in Hebrew)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;22:26:20&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“What’s the bottom line here? The bottom line is that we have to live together in this city - one third is Palestinian, one third Jewish ultra-orthodox and one third all the rest. As representatives of a small part of ‘all the rest’, we should be more careful in choosing whom we serve and how, and think how we can contribute to coexistence in this city. This is what I think, not only as a professional archaeologist but also from an ethical point of view according to which archeology should be a tool for peace and coexistence and not for fire and brimstone.”&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Let&#39;s Make A Website</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a fun project: albeit one with severe undertones of narcissism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some great things have come out of it though: I got back in touch with some wonderful people from my past who I haven’t spoken to for far too long. Who said that technology was a lonely business?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Future plans for this site include: pointing people here instead of writing long repetitive emails, and writing down my thoughts and refering back to them later when I’ve forgotten everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator written in Ruby, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-documentation/basics&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt;, an odd language written for Shopify that is severely restrictive, but at least gives the old gray matter a bit of a workout. Rather than making pages in html or html.erb as usual, I opted for the world of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The styling is mostly down to the lovely &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css&quot;&gt;Tufte CSS.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map page is built using the Datamaps wrapper for the “how on earth did anyone do anything before this?” godsend of a data visualisation library &lt;a href=&quot;http://datamaps.github.io/&quot;&gt;D3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The site is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 		&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&gt;The tribute album on Rif Mountain&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rif Mountain is an independent co-op label specialising in underground folk music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Village Thing was self-dubbed ‘the alternative folk label’ way back when it began in 1970, and although it lasted only 4 years (and 20-odd releases), the music they released continues to be revered today with key albums being reissued by the likes of Light in the Attic and Sunbeam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Village Thing man and current fRoots editor Ian Anderson asked us to contribute to a tribute album, the yearning lyrics of “The Island”, originally written and recorded by troubadour guitarist and songwriter Al Jones, immediately jumped out at us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recorded it at our studio, Hot Salt Beef (there’s another story there), in London and released in exclusively on Echoes From The Mountain, Rif Mountain Records, 2011.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;me: voice, trumpet&lt;br /&gt;
Ben Mandelson: harmonica, plectrum banjo&lt;br /&gt;
Yaniv Fridel: mix, mastering&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wonderful psychological thriller about the lunacy that is the life of a professional chess player. I’d been a fan of Halil Efrat since his delightful debut ‘Souvenirs’. So to compose the music for his latest feature doc with my partner Yaniv Fridel was a real pleasure, as we knew in advance the result would be worth watching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an excellent interview with the director about the film from an insightful chess writer in The Hindu &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/blink/play/border-of-order-and-chaos/article6574022.ece&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Blurb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Chess Championship is a juicy battle, rife with passion, power and money. Boris Gelfand has spent his entire life getting ready for this moment; he was raised to become a champion since the age of six. His father devoted all his life to cultivating Boris’ chess skills and imposing a demanding schedule on him. The photo albums documenting the process tell the father’s story as much as that of the son, revealing a simple truth about a man living his own dreams under the Soviet regime through his son. Is becoming a genius worth the price?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Press&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A wonderful display of the documentary director&#39;s art. Turning the world chess championship into a nerve wracking drama and a careful examination of the impact of parental ambition. Jury&#39;s statement&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>The Wild Ones</title>
                <description>

 		&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first met the British documentary director &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/user10836861&quot;&gt;Lucy Kaye &lt;/a&gt;when I saw Together Alone, her graduation film from the National Film and Television School. It was such a touching, sensitive portrayal of the difficulties of old age in London that I went straight up to her after the screening and had to thank her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we were of course delighted when she asked me and my studio partner Yaniv to compose the music for her first Channel 4 film, “The Wild Ones” (which Channel 4 cheesily renamed ‘Teen Horse Whisperers’, but that’s another story.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

 		&lt;/span&gt;
 		&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&gt;A pupil and a horse working together&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What Lucy made was a beautiful, sensitive, very moving film. Sadly it can’t be embedded on other websites, but I heartily recommend you go and watch it &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/54937192&quot;&gt;on Lucy’s Vimeo page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Blurb&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact Pupil Referral Unit, in Bootle, Liverpool, provides a last chance for teenagers expelled from school to gain qualifications. This term, seven pupils get to leave the Unit to try a new way of learning in an unlikely sanctuary for rescued horses, in the heart of this run-down neighborhood. Run by local resident Bernadette Langfield, several wild ponies that she saved from being culled need taming. But these horses, like the pupils have their own troubled backgrounds and in order for a relationship between them to develop, both horses and teenagers have to first deal with their own behavioral difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Press&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Run by Bernadette Langfield the Shy Lowen Horse and Pony Sanctuary in Liverpool specializes in taming horses with behavioural problems, horses that have been deemed “difficult”. Langfield believes these stunning creatures have a natural ability to pick up on our emotional states, and she is utilizing this gift to the benefit of both horses and people. The latest in the First Cut series of debut documentaries is this charming and touching film by Lucy Kaye, following a group of problem teenagers a sthey spend two months with Langfield. The results – for both human and horse – are quite astonishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another lovely film from a series that should be persuading the soap opera audience to make the switch to documentary. This features a group of young Liverpudlians whose behaviour has seen them exiled from mainstream schooling. They now attend “classes” at a horse sanctuary, and in learning to work with big, injured, frightened animals, they are taught to control their own moods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy Kaye&#39;s rather lovely First Cut documentary looks at the work of Impact, an alternative school in Liverpool, and the Shy Lowen Horse and Pony Sanctuary. It shows how pupils with behavioural issues are encouraged to work with unwanted, wild horses, who need taming before they can be reintegrated with their herds. The parallels between the animal and human adolescents are obvious but this makes the task ahead of the teenagers no less of a challenge, as they must first confront their own difficulties before addressing those of the horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;David Stubbs, Guardian&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mellow, wise little film tells a tale of disruptive teenagers on Merseyside and their unlikely therapy programme. A brilliant woman called Bernie runs a charity in Bootle that brings the teenagers together with rescued horses. The students must win the trust of the horses (which have behavioural problems of their own) and learn how to assert themselves, without being threatening or giving up. A lot of it comes down to body language and confidence - so there&#39;s one big life lesson right there. It&#39;s therapeutic just watching the sessions as horses and teens tame each other, though it&#39;s no surprise when we learn that this enlightened programme faces closure as a result of cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;David Butcher, Radio Times&lt;/footer&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Impact is a school for students in Liverpool who have been removed from mainstream education because they have difficulty controlling their behaviour. 

Where better than Bernie&#39;s pony sanctuary? The animals have something in common with the children: both have been treated badly. Anneliese was not beaten with planks nor crushed between two gates and tagged, but she did look after her alcoholic mother and siblings before being taken into care. Bernie grew up on a council estate. &quot;What&#39;s the word when everything is run down and there&#39;s no money?&quot; She couldn&#39;t remember. No one could. Anyway, growing up there &quot;was quite tough&quot;.

She explained to the huddle of teenagers that the horses didn&#39;t behave badly after their first day at the sanctuary. Why was that, she asked. No answer. &quot;It&#39;s because they&#39;re allowed to be horses.&quot; You waited for the inevitable retort. It didn&#39;t come. Perhaps they were wondering if Bernie was drawing an analogy.

She believes that, by becoming aware of the horses&#39; actions, the youngsters will become more aware of their own. Horses, she tells them, are able to pick up what people are feeling and this helps the likes of John to get in touch with his emotions. At first he backed away from his pony but, encouraged by Bernie, he was soon brushing it down, feeding it apples and even leading it round the paddock. When she told him how proud she was of his achievement, he ran off. He wasn&#39;t used to praise.

Government cuts mean Impact may have to close. And then what will happen to kids like John? There should be kindness as well as Kindles.&lt;p&gt;

 	I think it lost its way after Coltrane, with a few exceptions like the consciousness of Sun Ra, Pharoah Sanders et al on Impulse, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QuhUwa0ETY&quot;&gt; best band in the world&lt;/a&gt;, but that is another story.
 	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a young trumpet player bored of jazz, there were only two choices as far as I knew: Gypsy or Cuban. I couldn’t afford the airfare to Miami, let alone Cuba, and I knew Russian, so I figured if I didn’t know Romanes, at least I could blag it in Serbian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so began a lifelong love affair with Gypsy brass music. Somehow I found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.galbeno.com/&quot;&gt;Amala&lt;/a&gt;, a Gypsy music school, and called them up. Instead of going to their school, could they find me a family to live with play with for a month? “Sure,” said the cracked voice at the end of the line, “you just come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

 	Dragan in someone&#39;s living room doing his thang
 	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so with a trumpet, a few deutschmarks and not much else, I found myself getting off a train in Belgrade station to meet Dragan Ristic, a cheerful, bald chain-smoker who turned out to be a top guitarist and local political Roma activist from a well-known Belgrade theatre family.&lt;/p&gt;

                <description>
&lt;p&gt;I have been a keen linguist ever since I remember. I am blessed that my family live all over the world, and as such, grew up hearing different languages in the house when relatives came to visit. I was lucky enough to go to a school where languages were available, and had a teacher when I was thirteen who changed my life. Hani Al-Hawi was an Iraqi Christian with a large belly and a jolly demeanour. He played at being angry with the class, barking at them when they got things wrong, but had a heart of gold. From the first week in French class, he quietly gave me ‘Bel Ami’ by Guy De Maupassant, and told me that I was excused homework for the rest of the term if I read that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kicked off a love of languages that has stayed with me. I know of no greater thrill that the first lessons in a new language, when you can start to see light through a previously impenetrable wall of sound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a year in Russia studying trumpet, paying my way as an English teacher, using “Headway” by Cambridge University Press, a global standard in English as a Foreign Language, which also happens to be a terribly well-meaning, well-researched yawnfest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a performing musician, I had seen the phenomenon of music and language close-up. In &amp;lt;a href=”{“layout”=&amp;gt;”music”, “year”=&amp;gt;”1999-2007”, “title”=&amp;gt;”Oi Va Voi”, “description”=&amp;gt;”The story behind the NY Times Top Ten Band”, “image”=&amp;gt;”OiVaVoi_15.jpg”, “category”=&amp;gt;”music”, “area”=&amp;gt;”band”, “label”=&amp;gt;”Outcaste / V2”, “publisher”=&amp;gt;”Outcaste / EMI”, “artist”=&amp;gt;[“Oi Va Voi”], “tags”=&amp;gt;[“Oi Va Voi”, “world”, “klezmer”, “political”, “pop”], “people”=&amp;gt;[“Mike Spencer / Bacon &amp;amp; Quarmby - production”, “Moshikop / Andy Coules - sound/mixing”, “Nik Ammar - guitar”, “Josh Breslaw - drums”, “Steve Levi - clarinet”, “Leo Bryant - bass”, “Sophie Solomon / Anna Phoebe - violin”, “KT Tunstall / Alice McLaughlin / Bridgette Amofah - vocals”], “video”=&amp;gt;”h2572hLy7AA”, “videotext”=&amp;gt;”At this show the crowd even sang me Happy Birthday.

On stage, I sang and played trumpet. With the band I made three records: people seemed to like us, and we played some decent shows. We were signed to Outcaste/EMI, and then Virgin/V2. I was lucky enough to work at length with some outrageously talented people, like KT Tunstall, Mike Spencer, Paul Epworth, Maurice El Medioni.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was a longstanding labour of love, my formative musical experience: undertaken at a time when I was looking deeply into my roots and identity, and found a community of musicians and voyagers to share it with.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&quot;sideimage&quot; title=&quot;Click to enlarge&quot; src=&quot;/assets/themes/tufte/images/groningen.jpg&quot; /&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&amp;gt;Groningen, 2003. I hadn’t realised the show would be televised, and so wrote the lyrics to a brand new song on my hand. Whoops&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I started the band at University, having fallen in love with a Hungarian folk dancer. Having grown up on a diet of hip-hop, soul and jazz, hearing folk music for the first time was a revelation. My girlfriend took me to a táncház, a traditional Hungarian folk ceilidh. The musicians were on stage playing as we arrived - a violin, two violas and a three-stringed double bass. As we stood in line to check in our coats, I started to nod my head unconsciously. I looked up and saw that everyone in the queue was doing the same. It was just like waiting in line in a club - the music filters through the door past the bouncer, and everyone on the pavement is bobbing in anticipation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&quot;sideimage&quot; title=&quot;Click to enlarge&quot; src=&quot;/assets/themes/tufte/images/trumpet-travel.jpg&quot; /&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&amp;gt;Have trumpet, will travel. Rome, 2004&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;A light bulb went off. This was pure dance music, just like Twice As Nice and Subterranea, the clubs I went to in London. Inside, it looked like a barndance, but the music was even more like the clubs I knew. Instead of drums and bass, there was a double bass and two violas, but the way they played - in hypnotic, repeated phrases with the violin singing a melody on top - allowed the dancers to almost ignore the music, and just do their thing.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I came out of that experience buzzing, and grabbed every recording of Hungarian folk music I could.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One thing led to another, and back at University, I formed a band with some friends. The repertoire was mostly Gypsy and Hungarian stuff I had picked up on my travels. We were enthusiastic… and not that good.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Being a mostly self-taught musician, with the exception of a wonderful year in Moscow at the Gnessinka Conservatory with the late trumpet and breathing guru, Evgeniy Alexandrovich Savin, I wanted to get some theory behind me for songwriting, so I took a one-year conversion course at the superb adult education centre in South London, Morley College.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&quot;sideimage&quot; title=&quot;Click to enlarge&quot; src=&quot;/assets/themes/tufte/images/handshake.JPG&quot; /&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&amp;gt;The hand ball of fire: our ritual just before going on stage&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;There I met drummer Josh Breslaw, a professional musician, and when he agreed to join the band, we stepped things up a gear. We got our first international shows, with my old studio partner, now Grammy-winning producer &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://paulepworth.com&quot;&amp;gt;Paul Epworth&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; on sound and got our first press write-up after a main stage show at the Dranouter Festival, Belgium. From that point on we knew we had a shot, and had to dedicated ourselves to the band full-time.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&quot;sideimage&quot; title=&quot;Click to enlarge&quot; src=&quot;/assets/themes/tufte/images/milan.jpg&quot; /&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&amp;gt;Giving it some in Italy on our first European tour&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;I wrote my &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/lyrics/oivavoi/tatarlovesong.html&quot;&amp;gt;first song&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; for the band and we self-funded our first album at the legendary Livingston Studio in London’s Wood Green. From there, things spiralled: we started to play international festivals regularly, and a showcase at WOMEX 2002 got us an introduction to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://martinmorales.com&quot;&amp;gt;Martin Morales&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, then A&amp;amp;R for Outcaste/EMI Records, a record deal, and an international touring agent - the fantastic &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://elasticartists.net&quot;&amp;gt;Jon Slade at Elastic&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, home to Gilles Peterson amongst other heroes.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&quot;sideimage&quot; title=&quot;Click to enlarge&quot; src=&quot;/assets/themes/tufte/images/bootlegs.JPG&quot; /&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&amp;gt;An entire stand of bootlegged tour merchandise outside the venue in Milan. We felt we had really arrived.&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Signing to Outcaste Records was a dream come true for me. Since my DJ-ing days, they had been my favourite label - home to &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://nitinsawhney.com&quot;&amp;gt;Nitin Sawhney&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;, a British-Indian artist who had spent the last five years redefining what British music sounded like.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;It was the time of the Iraq war. The leader of the Conservatives was trying to prove his Britishness by clamping down on immigration. I wrote &amp;lt;a href=&quot;/lyrics/oivavoi/refugee.html&quot;&amp;gt;Refugee&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt; as a protest: it was a sleeper hit that put the band on the map.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&quot;sideimage&quot; title=&quot;Click to enlarge&quot; src=&quot;/assets/themes/tufte/images/jonkt.JPG&quot; /&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&amp;gt;Backstage with KT at our debut album launch, Bedford Arms, London, 2003&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One year later, after a show at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, a primary school teacher approched me and told me she had used the song as the focus of an annual class project about immigration and identity. I was so proud: to see that music could have an effect far beyond a song itself was a defining moment in my musical development.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We spent the next 4 years on the road almost constantly, playing Glastonbury several times, in the USA and across Europe, making videos and helping to launch the career of &amp;lt;a href=&quot;http://kttunstall.com&quot;&amp;gt;one of the UK’s biggest singers of the decade&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;img class=&quot;sideimage&quot; title=&quot;Click to enlarge&quot; src=&quot;/assets/themes/tufte/images/caracol.JPG&quot; /&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n \t\t&amp;lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&amp;gt;TV interview at Caracol, Barcelona, 2004&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;We changed labels, signed to V2, and worked with some wonderful international artists and producers. Working consistently at this level taught me some invaluable tricks of the music trade, in all its good and bad aspects.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 2007, I was newly-married and fell out of love with the touring life, seeking a more meaningful way to spend the 23 hours a day that you are not on stage. We’d played 250+ shows around the world, and I was ready for a change. I handed over my baby to the other band members, now a business that could support eight people full-time, and sought out new challenges.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n\n&lt;!-- soundcloud: 158696711 --&gt;\n\n&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Accolades&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\nInternational Album of the Year&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;Edison Awards, Netherlands (Dutch Music Industry), 2003&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\nCritics’ Top Ten Album of the Year&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;New York Times, 2003&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\nBoundary Crossing Award Nomination&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;BBC Radio 3 World Music Awards, 2003&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\nListeners Award Nomination&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;BBC Radio 3 World Music Awards, 2003&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;h3&amp;gt;Press&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\n\t&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of this year’s revelations&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt; \n&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;Dranouter Festival, Belgium, 2000&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\nClassy vocalists and lyrics that search for and celebrate identity - a diaspora-wide delight.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;Observer&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\nThe two openers Refugee and Yesterday’s Mistakes have hit written all over them and the warm, breathy tone of KT Tunstall’s vocals takes you back to the most magical, wistful summer’s day you ever spent in the metropolis.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;Songlines&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;\n&quot;Oi Va Voi were something else entirely: a wild, enthralling mix… their deluge of ideas leaves you breathless with wonder&quot;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;\t\n&amp;lt;footer&amp;gt;The Independent&amp;lt;/footer&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\n\n&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;\n&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;“A true 21st century fusion of styles, merging great songwriting, dope beats, world music and a surprisingly urban funk factor into an ever-morphing and ever-compelling tapestry.

I will never forget how an entire audience somewhere in Europe, consisting of English speakers of various abilities, can sing back a chorus line perfectly after a single listen. The music motivates them to listen and repeat. It is effortless learning, well outside any formal educational context. This image would not leave me be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to bore my friends with a kernel of an idea: could music videos - or any other Youtube videos that kids already love - be the core material for a new sor of English course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my teaching days, I knew that the problem with language courses was one of motivation. Kids would learn English well if only they finished the course - but they never did, tending to drop out through lack of interest. At the same time, the same kids were consuming vast amounts of English language video content at home - in gaming, music or TV/film - but their parents were telling them off for listening to this &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt; language, rather than encouraging them to learn by themselves. All the kids I had ever met who learnt English well did it through this unofficial, self-directed learning. Surely these same principles could be applied in the classroom too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked an acquaintance working in the Google Translate team about the state of machine comprehension. My question was: “Can computers classify the language in music videos and TV programmes by their grammar, frequency and spelling well enough for them to be used in a formal educational context?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He replied that yes, while machines tend to get things wrong a small percentage of the time, automatic language tools had just reached a plateau after decades of research, and now was the perfect time to embark on an ambitious project like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came across a contest organised by the Technology Strategy Board, now &lt;a href=&quot;http://innovateuk.org&quot;&gt;Innovate UK&lt;/a&gt;, to design a second screen application for television, as part of a collaboration with Hat Trick Productions, the UK’s biggest indie TV company. At that stage, the idea was nothing more than that, plus a feisty video pitch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got the money, I panicked, and set about finding a team. We built an Android demo for Hat Trick, which they liked a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got more funding from Innovate UK, and were accepted into WAYRA, a tech accelerator run by multinational telco Telefonica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year later, we had built &lt;a href=&quot;http://rebeats.tv&quot;&gt;ReBeats&lt;/a&gt;, an online video game that overlays subtitles over music videos, and asks the student a simple yes or no question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised at this point what I had bitten off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In launching my startup, I had inadvertantly thrown myself into multiple areas where I knew very little. I was a guy with a good idea, and the gift of the gab, and we were making a game that millions of users had to fall in love with, a hard enough task in itself. That was just the beginning.  I had to learn to speak many different dialects immediately: programming, finance, user experience, user interface design, corporate and contractual law, team management, recruitment, pedagogy, artificial intelligence, consumer marketing. I could not talk to the designers in the same language as the recruiters, or the accountant in the same language as the business managers. It was one hell of an upwards learning curve.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Hip-Hop Machine</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;Back in September 2014 I did a week-long course in London on the basics of statistical machine learning. Since Google bought a startup that plays &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deepmind.com&quot;&gt;video games better than any human being&lt;/a&gt; , everyone in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackernewsletter.com&quot;&gt;tech community&lt;/a&gt; was buzzing about artificial intelligence and machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;
 		
 		&lt;iframe width=&quot;auto&quot; height=&quot;auto&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/yY1FSsUV-8c&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; webkitallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot; mozallowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;
 		&lt;/iframe&gt;
 	&lt;/span&gt;
 	
 		&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;
	
 	Having been impressed by live coding and had a go at writing simple music making programmes in Javascript and Ruby, I wanted to try out working with rhythm, word stress and intonation too.
 	&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been interested in machine music-making and creativity for some time now, but machine learning seemed to open up all sorts of interesting new avenues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a lecture in City University, I met Dan Stowell, who uses computational analysis for wildlife conservation of birds - &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mcld.co.uk/research/&quot;&gt;machine listening&lt;/a&gt; - and heard about how you can use statistical machine learning, and specifically Hidden Markov Models, to count bird populations and identify species in jungle environments where visibility is next to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about how I could apply these ideas, I decided to build a site that writes and performs its own hip-hop, using the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;train a model on a database of existing pop lyrics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create rules for what constitutes good hiphop (poetic metre, assonance, strong and weak rhymes)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;create patterns for what constitutes good performance delivery, or ‘flow’&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use a Text to Speech engine to perform the lyrics over a beat of a certain BPM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had a starting point - the 1000 song hit pop database that we used to build &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;ReBeats&lt;/a&gt;, and in my search for ways to train it, cames across Markov Chains, which have been explained much better elsewhere than I can here. Markov Chains work well as generators for all sorts of things, most notably &lt;a href=&quot;http://joshmillard.com/garkov/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, writing new Garfield cartoon strips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is still a work in progress, and the hip-hop flow needs some work, but I’lll put up a working version as soon as I get the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;More&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For another project that creates machine lyrics using whole lines from existing songs, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.deepbeat.org/&quot;&gt;this app from Finland&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>Me and Coding</title>
                <description>
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 		&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://core0.staticworld.net/images/article/2015/01/11_software-development-100565790-gallery.idge.jpg&quot; /&gt;
 		&lt;/span&gt;
 		&lt;span class=&quot;marginnote buffer&quot;&gt;Then add a &#39;banking tax&#39; for London, and you&#39;re close&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not one of those stories about how I’ve been playing around with machines since I was a small boy, and discovered that the machine and I were actually one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a story about how I started a startup called &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tonguesten.com&quot;&gt;Tonguesten&lt;/a&gt; and discovered that London was a great place to be a computer, and a nightmare place to start a startup. I won’t bore you with the reasons here, but the infographic on the right says it all: London has a mighty financial sector with deep pockets, and a neanderthal visa regime for overseas programmers. Little startups who aren’t able to build their own products need big investment upfront, or will die before their coffee gets cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an oft-repeated fact that 90% of startups die in the first three years. We made it out of that demographic - just - but it was clear to me from the beginning that this brave new world belongs to coders, and if I trained myself up, I would have not regrets even if we did end up just another statistic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did some online courses for free, and then took three intensive week-long courses - paid for by the company to compensate for my pitiful salary: in &lt;a href=&quot;http:/rubylang.org&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, a backend, server-side language, in Javascript, the dynamic language of the web, and in statistical Machine Learning, the backbone of artificial intelligence applications from Google Search onwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a revelation to discover that coding is not magic, but a fairly simple amalgamation of logic, mathematics and clear design.  And so I started playing with code, first building &lt;a href=&quot;/tech/2015/10/26/alphabet-ninja&quot;&gt;a game for my newborn daughter&lt;/a&gt; to teach her spelling, which she still loves to play some two years on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I left the heavy lifting in &lt;a href=&quot;/tech/2015/10/26/rebeats&quot;&gt;Tonguesten&lt;/a&gt; to other programmers, I began to experiment with natural language processing and artificial intelligence, making small art projects. I wrote a  programme that writes and performs its own music lyrics, a library to make video mashups, a scraper that gave me the daily news digest from the websites that I liked to read the most. I experimented with real-time interactive computing through &lt;a href=&quot;http://openframeworks.org&quot;&gt;Open Frameworks&lt;/a&gt;, got interested in the analogue-digital conversion &lt;a href=&quot;http://arduino.net&quot;&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt; hardware board, and saw that the step from being a consumer to maker is smaller now than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To anyone who thinks that coding is hard, think of me as an example. Search &lt;a href=&quot;http://coursera.org&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; for beginner programming courses - the University of Toronto course is particularly good - and stop consuming.&lt;/p&gt;
