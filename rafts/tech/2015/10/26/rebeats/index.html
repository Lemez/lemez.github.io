      <br>
        
      
<p>I have been a keen linguist ever since I remember. I am blessed that my family live all over the world, and as such, grew up hearing different languages in the house when relatives came to visit. I was lucky enough to go to a school where languages were available, and had a teacher when I was thirteen who changed my life. Hani Al-Hawi was an Iraqi Christian with a large belly and a jolly demeanour. He played at being angry with the class, barking at them when they got things wrong, but had a heart of gold. From the first week in French class, he quietly gave me ‘Bel Ami’ by Guy De Maupassant, and told me that I was excused homework for the rest of the term if I read that.</p>

<p>This kicked off a love of languages that has stayed with me. I know of no greater thrill that the first lessons in a new language, when you can start to see light through a previously impenetrable wall of sound.</p>

<p>I spent a year in Russia studying trumpet, paying my way as an English teacher, using “Headway” by Cambridge University Press, a global standard in English as a Foreign Language, which also happens to be a terribly well-meaning, well-researched yawnfest.</p>

<p>As a performing musician, I had seen the phenomenon of music and language close-up. In &lt;a href=”{“layout”=&gt;”music”, “year”=&gt;”1999-2007”, “title”=&gt;”Oi Va Voi”, “description”=&gt;”The story behind the NY Times Top Ten Band”, “image”=&gt;”OiVaVoi_15.jpg”, “category”=&gt;”music”, “area”=&gt;”band”, “label”=&gt;”Outcaste / V2”, “publisher”=&gt;”Outcaste / EMI”, “artist”=&gt;[“Oi Va Voi”], “tags”=&gt;[“Oi Va Voi”, “world”, “klezmer”, “political”, “pop”], “people”=&gt;[“Mike Spencer / Bacon &amp; Quarmby - production”, “Moshikop / Andy Coules - sound/mixing”, “Nik Ammar - guitar”, “Josh Breslaw - drums”, “Steve Levi - clarinet”, “Leo Bryant - bass”, “Sophie Solomon / Anna Phoebe - violin”, “KT Tunstall / Alice McLaughlin / Bridgette Amofah - vocals”], “video”=&gt;”h2572hLy7AA”, “videotext”=&gt;”At this show the crowd even sang me Happy Birthday. Happy Days.”, “url”=&gt;”/music/2015/10/22/oi-va-voi”, “dir”=&gt;”/music/2015/10/22”, “date”=&gt;2015-10-22 00:00:00 +0530, “id”=&gt;”/music/2015/10/22/oi-va-voi”, “categories”=&gt;[“music”], “next”=&gt;#Jekyll:Post @id=”/music/2015/10/22/sevara”, “previous”=&gt;#Jekyll:Post @id=”/blog/2015/10/22/music-therapy-observations—a-week-with-nigel-osborne”, “path”=&gt;”_posts/music/2015-10-22-oi-va-voi.md”, “content”=&gt;”\n&lt;p&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;&lt;img class="sideimage" title="Click to enlarge" src="/assets/themes/tufte/images/1a.jpg" /&gt;\n \t\t&lt;/span&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote buffer"&gt;Receiving an Edison Award onstage, Paradiso, Amsterdam, 2004&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="newthought"&gt;I founded, &lt;/span&gt;wrote for and led a band for 7 years. On stage, I sang and played trumpet. With the band I made three records: people seemed to like us, and we played some decent shows. We were signed to Outcaste/EMI, and then Virgin/V2. I was lucky enough to work at length with some outrageously talented people, like KT Tunstall, Mike Spencer, Paul Epworth, Maurice El Medioni.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was a longstanding labour of love, my formative musical experience: undertaken at a time when I was looking deeply into my roots and identity, and found a community of musicians and voyagers to share it with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;&lt;img class="sideimage" title="Click to enlarge" src="/assets/themes/tufte/images/groningen.jpg" /&gt;\n \t\t&lt;/span&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote buffer"&gt;Groningen, 2003. I hadn’t realised the show would be televised, and so wrote the lyrics to a brand new song on my hand. Whoops&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I started the band at University, having fallen in love with a Hungarian folk dancer. Having grown up on a diet of hip-hop, soul and jazz, hearing folk music for the first time was a revelation. My girlfriend took me to a táncház, a traditional Hungarian folk ceilidh. The musicians were on stage playing as we arrived - a violin, two violas and a three-stringed double bass. As we stood in line to check in our coats, I started to nod my head unconsciously. I looked up and saw that everyone in the queue was doing the same. It was just like waiting in line in a club - the music filters through the door past the bouncer, and everyone on the pavement is bobbing in anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;&lt;img class="sideimage" title="Click to enlarge" src="/assets/themes/tufte/images/trumpet-travel.jpg" /&gt;\n \t\t&lt;/span&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote buffer"&gt;Have trumpet, will travel. Rome, 2004&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A light bulb went off. This was pure dance music, just like Twice As Nice and Subterranea, the clubs I went to in London. Inside, it looked like a barndance, but the music was even more like the clubs I knew. Instead of drums and bass, there was a double bass and two violas, but the way they played - in hypnotic, repeated phrases with the violin singing a melody on top - allowed the dancers to almost ignore the music, and just do their thing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I came out of that experience buzzing, and grabbed every recording of Hungarian folk music I could.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One thing led to another, and back at University, I formed a band with some friends. The repertoire was mostly Gypsy and Hungarian stuff I had picked up on my travels. We were enthusiastic… and not that good.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Being a mostly self-taught musician, with the exception of a wonderful year in Moscow at the Gnessinka Conservatory with the late trumpet and breathing guru, Evgeniy Alexandrovich Savin, I wanted to get some theory behind me for songwriting, so I took a one-year conversion course at the superb adult education centre in South London, Morley College.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;&lt;img class="sideimage" title="Click to enlarge" src="/assets/themes/tufte/images/handshake.JPG" /&gt;\n \t\t&lt;/span&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote buffer"&gt;The hand ball of fire: our ritual just before going on stage&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There I met drummer Josh Breslaw, a professional musician, and when he agreed to join the band, we stepped things up a gear. We got our first international shows, with my old studio partner, now Grammy-winning producer &lt;a href="http://paulepworth.com"&gt;Paul Epworth&lt;/a&gt; on sound and got our first press write-up after a main stage show at the Dranouter Festival, Belgium. From that point on we knew we had a shot, and had to dedicated ourselves to the band full-time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;&lt;img class="sideimage" title="Click to enlarge" src="/assets/themes/tufte/images/milan.jpg" /&gt;\n \t\t&lt;/span&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote buffer"&gt;Giving it some in Italy on our first European tour&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote my &lt;a href="/lyrics/oivavoi/tatarlovesong.html"&gt;first song&lt;/a&gt; for the band and we self-funded our first album at the legendary Livingston Studio in London’s Wood Green. From there, things spiralled: we started to play international festivals regularly, and a showcase at WOMEX 2002 got us an introduction to &lt;a href="http://martinmorales.com"&gt;Martin Morales&lt;/a&gt;, then A&amp;R for Outcaste/EMI Records, a record deal, and an international touring agent - the fantastic &lt;a href="http://elasticartists.net"&gt;Jon Slade at Elastic&lt;/a&gt;, home to Gilles Peterson amongst other heroes.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;&lt;img class="sideimage" title="Click to enlarge" src="/assets/themes/tufte/images/bootlegs.JPG" /&gt;\n \t\t&lt;/span&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote buffer"&gt;An entire stand of bootlegged tour merchandise outside the venue in Milan. We felt we had really arrived.&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Signing to Outcaste Records was a dream come true for me. Since my DJ-ing days, they had been my favourite label - home to &lt;a href="http://nitinsawhney.com"&gt;Nitin Sawhney&lt;/a&gt;, a British-Indian artist who had spent the last five years redefining what British music sounded like.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It was the time of the Iraq war. The leader of the Conservatives was trying to prove his Britishness by clamping down on immigration. I wrote &lt;a href="/lyrics/oivavoi/refugee.html"&gt;Refugee&lt;/a&gt; as a protest: it was a sleeper hit that put the band on the map.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;&lt;img class="sideimage" title="Click to enlarge" src="/assets/themes/tufte/images/jonkt.JPG" /&gt;\n \t\t&lt;/span&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote buffer"&gt;Backstage with KT at our debut album launch, Bedford Arms, London, 2003&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One year later, after a show at the Paradiso in Amsterdam, a primary school teacher approched me and told me she had used the song as the focus of an annual class project about immigration and identity. I was so proud: to see that music could have an effect far beyond a song itself was a defining moment in my musical development.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We spent the next 4 years on the road almost constantly, playing Glastonbury several times, in the USA and across Europe, making videos and helping to launch the career of &lt;a href="http://kttunstall.com"&gt;one of the UK’s biggest singers of the decade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;&lt;img class="sideimage" title="Click to enlarge" src="/assets/themes/tufte/images/caracol.JPG" /&gt;\n \t\t&lt;/span&gt;\n \t\t&lt;span class="marginnote buffer"&gt;TV interview at Caracol, Barcelona, 2004&lt;/span&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We changed labels, signed to V2, and worked with some wonderful international artists and producers. Working consistently at this level taught me some invaluable tricks of the music trade, in all its good and bad aspects.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In 2007, I was newly-married and fell out of love with the touring life, seeking a more meaningful way to spend the 23 hours a day that you are not on stage. We’d played 250+ shows around the world, and I was ready for a change. I handed over my baby to the other band members, now a business that could support eight people full-time, and sought out new challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n<!-- soundcloud: 158696711 -->\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Accolades&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nInternational Album of the Year&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;Edison Awards, Netherlands (Dutch Music Industry), 2003&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nCritics’ Top Ten Album of the Year&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;New York Times, 2003&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nBoundary Crossing Award Nomination&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;BBC Radio 3 World Music Awards, 2003&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nListeners Award Nomination&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;BBC Radio 3 World Music Awards, 2003&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;h3&gt;Press&lt;/h3&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n\t&lt;p&gt;One of this year’s revelations&lt;/p&gt; \n&lt;footer&gt;Dranouter Festival, Belgium, 2000&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nClassy vocalists and lyrics that search for and celebrate identity - a diaspora-wide delight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;Observer&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\nThe two openers Refugee and Yesterday’s Mistakes have hit written all over them and the warm, breathy tone of KT Tunstall’s vocals takes you back to the most magical, wistful summer’s day you ever spent in the metropolis.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;footer&gt;Songlines&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n"Oi Va Voi were something else entirely: a wild, enthralling mix… their deluge of ideas leaves you breathless with wonder"&lt;/p&gt;\t\n&lt;footer&gt;The Independent&lt;/footer&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;“A true 21st century fusion of styles, merging great songwriting, dope beats, world music and a surprisingly urban funk factor into an ever-morphing and ever-compelling tapestry.

I will never forget how an entire audience somewhere in Europe, consisting of English speakers of various abilities, can sing back a chorus line perfectly after a single listen. The music motivates them to listen and repeat. It is effortless learning, well outside any formal educational context. This image would not leave me be.</p>

<p>I started to bore my friends with a kernel of an idea: could music videos - or any other Youtube videos that kids already love - be the core material for a new sor of English course.</p>

<p>From my teaching days, I knew that the problem with language courses was one of motivation. Kids would learn English well if only they finished the course - but they never did, tending to drop out through lack of interest. At the same time, the same kids were consuming vast amounts of English language video content at home - in gaming, music or TV/film - but their parents were telling them off for listening to this <em>bad</em> language, rather than encouraging them to learn by themselves. All the kids I had ever met who learnt English well did it through this unofficial, self-directed learning. Surely these same principles could be applied in the classroom too?</p>

<p>I asked an acquaintance working in the Google Translate team about the state of machine comprehension. My question was: “Can computers classify the language in music videos and TV programmes by their grammar, frequency and spelling well enough for them to be used in a formal educational context?”</p>

<p>He replied that yes, while machines tend to get things wrong a small percentage of the time, automatic language tools had just reached a plateau after decades of research, and now was the perfect time to embark on an ambitious project like mine.</p>

<p>I came across a contest organised by the Technology Strategy Board, now <a href="http://innovateuk.org">Innovate UK</a>, to design a second screen application for television, as part of a collaboration with Hat Trick Productions, the UK’s biggest indie TV company. At that stage, the idea was nothing more than that, plus a feisty video pitch.</p>

<p>We got the money, I panicked, and set about finding a team. We built an Android demo for Hat Trick, which they liked a lot.</p>

<p>We got more funding from Innovate UK, and were accepted into WAYRA, a tech accelerator run by multinational telco Telefonica.</p>

<p>A year later, we had built <a href="http://rebeats.tv">ReBeats</a>, an online video game that overlays subtitles over music videos, and asks the student a simple yes or no question.</p>

<p>I realised at this point what I had bitten off.</p>

<p>In launching my startup, I had inadvertantly thrown myself into multiple areas where I knew very little. I was a guy with a good idea, and the gift of the gab, and we were making a game that millions of users had to fall in love with, a hard enough task in itself. That was just the beginning.  I had to learn to speak many different dialects immediately: programming, finance, user experience, user interface design, corporate and contractual law, team management, recruitment, pedagogy, artificial intelligence, consumer marketing. I could not talk to the designers in the same language as the recruiters, or the accountant in the same language as the business managers. It was one hell of an upwards learning curve.</p>
