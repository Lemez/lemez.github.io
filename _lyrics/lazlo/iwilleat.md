I was walking one morning    
When I stopped for a coffee and cake  
The milk there was sour  
and the chocolate in my biscuit was fake  
I take me a shower  
Feel the milk running down my hair  
Now the waitress is screaming  
As I'm eating the table and chair:  
I'm a freak in a bible scene.  

So I eat what I can   
til I'm eating everything I can see  
With a mouth in my hand  
I understand what it is to be free  
The bus is free to eat everyone on board  
The priest is even freer cos he eats the Lord  
So I will eat everything that I see  
Before it eats me.  

I believe in Jaguars   
I believe in chocolate bars  
I believe in looking better trying better   
Living better betting liver giving head  
And dying sooner better.  

When you consume you're a child  
And the world's made of sugar and sex  
You've got room in your tummy for pilots and jumbo jets  
No need to diet and get depressed  

Live in sects die in sects  
Live in sex die for sex  
Sugar tax sex attacks taxi cabs cabbage patch  
Sugar sugar sugar daddy  
Sugar sugar sugar child  
Sugar style sugar dial  
I want to eat my bicycle  

The doctor says I'm whole  
But I can't find my soul  
The doctor says I'm whole  
But I can't find my soul
