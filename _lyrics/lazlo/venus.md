CHORUS:  
Venus  
My girl  
with a penis.  

Miss Aphrodite woke up one morning  
Stood in her nightie, tired and yawning.  
Washes her face in front of the mirror,  
Just an ordinary day.  

Come in Mars - he's in his pyjamas.  
He's kamikaze but not into dramas.  
Feels the sun coming in through the window:  
She's got something important to say.  

CHORUS  

She says 'The Gods must have been calling  
On you and I this glorious morning.  
I hope this thing won't coe between us  
Except on a Saturday night.'  

Yes Mr Mars is also a woman  
And Mrs Venus is also a man  
So the two of them laugh,  
He takes her in his arms,  
His heart in the palm of her hand.  

CHORUS  

The lovers meet one might in Piccadilly.  
Salt beef on rye with piccalilli  
He's looking as handsome as a soldier  
She's glamorous like Marilyn, dress off the shoulder.  
She feels a cigarette butt on her neck.  
A voice says 'Faggot I'll teach you respect!'  
The crowd screams as one   
As a gunshot rings the air  
Leaves them on a wing and a prayer.  

CHORUS
