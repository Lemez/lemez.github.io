The official anthem of Muay Thai

The science of eight  
Standing alone on the battlefield  
The promise of peace  
The promise of how to defend the weak  
Making a vow  
To the power of will  
Showing our skill  
Following through  
A fighter who's true never knows defeat  

We are the art of heart and body -- Muaythai    
Pride and honour we embody -- Muaythai  
From a father to a son -- Muaythai  
A spirit stronger than a gun -- We are Muay Thai  

Through wars and tears  
Unarmed but with love we train  
Showing no fear  
Knowing the years of joy and pain  
A hand in a glove  
Teaching our children to dare  
For one and for all  
Standing tall  
The art of eight limbs free and fair  

We are the art of heart and body -- Muaythai  
Pride and honour we embody -- Muaythai  
From a father to a son -- Muaythai  
A spirit stronger than a gun -- We are Muaythai
