We tried so hard  
And signed a deal  
To make it all seem fair  
  
You promised if   
I’d stroke your back  
You’d give me clothes to wear  
  
We danced along  
Just you and I   
As if this life was never-ending  
  
And all the time  
The sweetest smell  
Of victory was pending  

If they don’t understand   
It’s just because we’re different  
  
Is it naïve   
That we still believe in innocence?  
  
CHORUS   
  
So, sleep, go to sleep  
Tell all your problems  
Lulla bye bye.  
  
Just sleep  
Go to sleep  
Singing my lullabye bye.
