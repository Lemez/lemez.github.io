The landscape all around us must be gone:  
The concrete hills are rushed into the past,  
Encasing just another slice of dust  
For future generations to extract.  
  
And when they sit there sifting through the facts  
They won’t remember moments that we spent  
Only broken plates will represent  
All we had in centuries to come.  
  
CHORUS  
But I’m still alive  
All I ask for is a pocket of air.  
I can’t see or feel the things that I should  
But in my bubble I can breathe deep.  
  
The trick to living long is not to move  
Never softly daydream of escape,  
Look for love so one day you’ll elope   
To places where you hardly see the sun  
  
Yet later after all is said and done  
Your letters will leak tears of things you miss  
The way that lovers here know how to kiss  
The day you lost yourself inside a tryst.  
  
CHORUS
  
They can tap on the outside  
As much as they like.  
People always feel the need to  
Pull you from the womb  
  
They can chase after good times  
As much as they like,  
But the key to being happy  
Is to let it come to you.

CHORUS
