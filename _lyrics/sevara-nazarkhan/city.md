Hot  
Poor   
Cold  
Cold.  
  
Hot city poor city city city  
Hot city poor city city city  
Hot city  Cold city Poor city Big city  
Big city Big city Big city Big city Big city  
  
(x2)  
Stay sated   
Restrained  
Tamed.  
Start again.  
  
(x2)  
Strait-jacket   
Check it’s straight  
Straight  
Straighter.    
  
(x2)  
Bigger city bigger city  
Gotta get a bigger city  
Hotter city hotter city  
Gotta get a hotter city   
  
(x2)  
Pain, strain and automobiles  
Shut it up.  
  
(x2)  
Background.  
Let down.  
Lock down.   
Tough luck.   
Shut it up.  
  
Slingshot.  
Dust.  
Snap shut.  
Us.  
Clam-like  
Lacklustre.  
Look back  
Luck ‘ll change.  
  
Gotta chain change  
Gotta chain change chain change chain change  
Train attain train attain train attain train  
  
Dusty 
City centre  
Tenses Senses  
Dissident  
Senses Tenses  
Citizen  
Tenses Senses Destiny  
Testing Destiny  
Testing Destiny  
One Two  
Just testing  
Jesting  
Chest in  
Breathe deep  
Chess game  
  
Same city   
In same  
Sane city  
Insane  
Same  
Intensity  
Density  
Ten cities  
  
Say it.  
Say it.  
Chain say it  
Chain say it  
Train say it   
Train say it   
Change say it  
Change say it
