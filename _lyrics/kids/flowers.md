All the flowers in the garden  
See how they follow me.  
I am the morning sun,  
I smile on everyone.  
If you see me, through the window  
You can relax a while.  
You know that everything  
That the day may bring  
Will be alright.  

While you're dreaming  
When youre sleeping  
I'm the first to wake  
I'll creep into your room  
And I'll caress your face.  
If youre careful  
In the night time  
A time when nothing moves  
You'll see my friend the moon  
Watching over you -  
I'll be back soon.  

CHORUS
And when the world is still  
I'm on the other side.  
While you are sleeping  
Other children play.  
Please don't be sad for me,  
I promise you I'm never far away.  

And when the world is still  
I'm on the other side.  
While you are sleeping  
Other children play.  
If I was with you now,  
You wouldn't wake up rested for the day.  

In the evening, when I'm leaving  
When my work is done,  
I have to pack my bags:  
My journey's just begun.  
All the colours in a chorus  
They gather in the sky.  
See all the birds take wing  
With my friend the wind  
To wave me goodbye.  

CHORUS
And when the world is still  
I'm on the other side.  
While you are sleeping  
Other children play.  
Please don't be sad for me,  
I promise you I'm never far away.  
I'm never far away.
