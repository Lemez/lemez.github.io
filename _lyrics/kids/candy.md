about: "A song written for the play The Latke Who Couldn't Stop Screaming, with a devised script based on the Lemony Snicket book and directed by the wonderful Tall Stories. At this point in the play, a peppermint candy cane makes an entrance. We decided that she rated herself a little too highly, so I wrote my first ever song about sweets and snacks with attitude. "

I've climbed pyramids of coconut  
I've been around the Milky Way  
I kick Reeses to pieces  
Crush Maltesers every day  
Cos they are not the sweets that everybody wants to eat  
Even when you're feeling sick  
All it takes it just one lick of  
Of the Candy  
  
CHORUS  
She's Candy, the Candy Cane  
And I'm the best  
She's minty, so minty fresh  
Cos I'm Candy  
She's Candy, the Candy Cane  
And I'm the best  
She's minty, so minty fresh  
  
Some girls like jammie dodgers  
Some like peny sweets  
Some like gobstoppers  
Or even wagon wheels  
Some boys like pink wafers  
Some like Fisherman's Friends  
You know it's always safer   
To stick to Candy in the end  
  
CHORUS  
  
I say Candy, you say Cane  
We say Candy, you say Cane  
  
Candy Candy Candy  
Cane Cane Cane
