about: "A song written for the play The Latke Who Couldn't Stop Screaming, with a devised script based on the Lemony Snicket book and directed by the wonderful Tall Stories. It ran at the Roundhouse in Camden as the alternative Xmas show, and then toured in the UK. <br>This song comes at the emotional high point, when the poor Latke is sitting under a tree, feeling exhausted, lost and trying to remember the days when he was truly loved. A real tear-jerker that was performed to perfection."

I'm not the kind of guy  
Who's used to being by myself.  
When I arrive in a room  
All the people go "Mmm!,  
I want one of those!"  
No other food  
Is as good at improving your mood.  
Turn a wintry night  
To a feeling of holding you warm and snug and tight.  
There's noone luckier than a latke.  

For the rest of the year  
People eat other things  
Like lettuce and ryvita.  
They crave me but save me   
For that one special time of the year.  
I know I'm not part of any diet  
But Chanukah without me:  
Do you really think anyone would actually buy it?  
No, there's noone luckier than a latke.
