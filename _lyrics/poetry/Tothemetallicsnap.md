To the metallic snap  
Of wind instructing ropes  
To beat out a tattoo  
With a flagpole for a drum,  
We rested, back to back,  
Impromptu, on a throne of  
Concrete slab by taxi rank.  
  
Our tendons, feeling awkward,  
Shifted forwards first then backwards,  
Til our curves, fully mirrored,  
In this late September not-quite-gale  
With just the sun to guide us,  
Found their centre, swaying, fused,  
Into a single, stolen snooze.
