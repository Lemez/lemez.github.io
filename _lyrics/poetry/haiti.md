The landscape must be flat now,
The concrete hills compressed,
Rushed into the past,
Just another slab of dust
From which future generations
Will prise remnants of last week,
Meals eaten off cheap plates - 
She bought them as our ‘in-betweens’ – 
That now will represent our buried dreams
And all we had in centuries to come.
 
Yet I, it seems, am not quite dead.
I must be lying in what people call
A pocket. Of air. 
I can’t see anything or feel anything 
But in my pocket, I can breathe.
 
What a perfect place to die!
All I ever looked for when living
Was a quiet place to think and be myself.
This death of mine will be much like this life
Save the rubble was then rabble:
Shards of splintered aspirations
Pressing down on every side.
A weight to fossilize the living.
 
The trick to surviving is 
Not to think of moving,
Not to daydream of escape. 
Countless friends and colleagues
Left on treasure hunts for oxygen:
Yet every letter home
fragments, misty-eyed,
For shells of taste, warmth and fragrance.

Listen to that. It sounds like tapping:
Heroes prodding sticks through cracks 
To pull me broken from this womb,
To a ranting symphony of prayer and flashbulb.
I fancy I can even hear
My darling brother calling out my name, 
Hoarse from white, frantic tears.
No. The illusion that 
Moving brings betterment 
Is not for me.
 
Wait, what is that buzzing?
Is this fly my fate?
What a glorious swipe of irony – 
My last companion to the great beyond,
The witness to my final testament.
Or are we not so ill-suited after all?
If you run after a fly, you will never catch it, 
And if you see it near, one grab and it is gone – 
In circles, without direction, except away.
 
No. The trick to being happy
Is not to think of moving.
Stay still, and allow it 
To settle
On you.
