---

With cock in hand - limp,  
distinctly unimpressed –   
we’re under starter’s orders.  
Thick-set men check watches  
Just a door’s breadth away,  
cough noisily on office chairs,  
spit Britishly in awkward banter   
“up the arse ‘n’ all!” as they await  
their turn to let loose fate  
in strip-lit, spare ‘production rooms’.  
  
How I love the world of doctors’ jargon!  
Every dirty, febrile verb and phoneme  
Disinfected, stripped, fully  
Cleansed from contagion  
Brought in on feral, salty tongues;  
And once sterilised,  
Distilled into a little labelled vial,  
squeaky clean enough for  
focus groups of multi-cultured bigots  
and our heroes’ line in witty bedside charm.  
  
Base, semantic smut is strictly not permitted  
in the cradle of fertility, the Jerusalem of jizz,   
the spunk Mecca of every colour, faith and creed.  
  
But deep in each production room,  
Amid the florid niceties  
Of dotted Is and cups of tea,  
A killer blow, disconsonant, awaits the naive.  
  
Discreetly in the corner  
As you enter, on the right   
Is the Plastic Box of Trauma –  
gurning fists of craven fetish –  
Readers’ Wives, Obese Babes, Over 45s:  
jaded pages stuck together,  
wretched flesh as crumpled trigger,  
bitter annals of sarcastic,  
grating, mocking, absent grins.  
  
Were Onan’s luv-er-ly assistants   
bought by a registrar on lunch break   
in a job lot off a website?  
  
Or collected in brown paper  
In a hospital whip round?  
  
Were they volunteer donations  
From a bleeding hearted public,   
Procured from the proceeds  
Of a 25K run?  
  
Did the line manager personally sign off  
Over   
Every  
Single   
One?  
  
These distractions won’t help now.  
At long last, my retching eyes,  
with superhuman focus, conspire   
to fake engagement long enough   
to force my weeping dignity   
to spineless, sputtering life.  
Matter over mind. Then run.  
  
Hours later, when humiliation’s   
wet brush has crusted over,  
Only an aching, nagging throb  
Serves to remind me of the fact that  
I have spilled myself,    
A tiny death,    
heart and soul into a jar 
for thawing years forward  
In my absence.  
If only I could take instead  
and bank on ice this gnawing.   
That night I see my motile self  
As still life.
