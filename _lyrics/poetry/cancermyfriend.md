It is a tribal dart of a word  
that stunts chitchat,  
clears small talk,  
induces avalanches.   
  
“Wasn’t the deadline last week?”  
“I’ve got cancer, my friend.”  
  
It is an asphyxiating word   
That turns people into fish:  
“Is there anything I can do?”  
gulps its echo down the phone  
as they thrash for chunks  
of random verbal air   
to mute the silence.  
  
It is a secret word to be shared   
Sparingly, in an almost whisper.  
The recipient will be thankful,   
Touched beyond compare.  
  
“I would love to, but I can’t.  
I’ve got cancer, my friend.”  
  
It is a microscopic fortress  
Built from razor-like bricks,  
Each brick a letter,  
Each letter a cell  
Broad enough  
to hide behind  
yet deft enough to slip  
between the ribs of any topic.  
  
It is a feigning, feinting word:  
a pop-up shop with mirrors  
To make one thing of another  
Or a monster in the cupboard  
Type of fairytale tangent   
From my hyper-active inner child’s  
Coolest, wildest dreams.  
  
It is tricksy, proto-legalese,  
the small print clause  
To end all bets.  
  
When God took out his cane  
This was Adam’s first excuse.  
  
It is something else though:  
A foundry of a word  
In which in amongst the chaos  
Many certainties are cast  
In a die of lucid vision.  
It is a seance to the present:  
An iron-wired connection  
To an honest, instant clarity,  
A hairline, trigger state  
Of now  
To oust petty questioning,   
Myopia, priorities.  
   
Every day I write  
To feel it sitting in my hand:  
It is a slender-billed curlew  
nesting,  
the rarest bird of opportunity,  
twitching elemental truth.  
  
“Sorry to cancel, but  
I’ve got cancer, my friend.”  
  
A shirker’s cloak,  
a slacker’s cattle-prod,  
the joker word in any pack of tongues.  
  
Cancer.  
My friend.
