There are some words   
Which are not spoken:  
They are spat or inhaled,  
Coughed or dragged  
From the larynx  
Like a recalcitrant child   
From a line.  
  
They go together  
Without effort  
In the choreography  
Of nerves:  
Statement spat;  
Inhaled reaction,  
One after another  
In the ongoing chain of  
Books and denial.  
  
These are not any words  
Of course but words  
That belong in  
The mouths of others  
From opposite poles,  
Where neural pathways   
Or so I’m told  
Flow counter to ours  
Out of magnetic spite.  
  
Though the spectacle is familiar,  
Its start is always stunning:  
A lorry-load of phonemes  
Swerve through the  
Central reservation   
In a god almighty pile-up  
Of indignant hypertension.  
   
I have learnt to  
Pronounce these words  
Without emotion,  
Even with nonchalance  
To those who breathe them  
As easily as mountain air.  
I too try to enjoy  
The carefree jaunt down  
Language’s slopes and hills,  
But alongside the thrill  
Of basking in the open air  
Is the drummed-in fear  
That in the end,  
My body cannot  
But choke.
