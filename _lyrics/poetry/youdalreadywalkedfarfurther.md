You’d already walked far further,  
Said far more that day  
Than most other days;  
Your usual/regular rhythm upset  
By our unseasonal presence.  
  
From your belltower   
I swear I heard at last  
A damp clanging awaken  
under thirty years of dust;  
that tower that had seemed so lofty  
unfathomably tall to a child  
eternally too small.  
Only later I understood that  
It was you who had built it,  
First as a retreat from where  
You’d kick down any ladder,  
With inner child abandon.  
When the last brick was laid,  
to jump down from what   
Had now become your prison  
Was to shatter every limb,  
To raze you to the ground.  
  
One must learn signs, signals,  
Semiotics  
To be a child.  
Well today I have earned  
My Bletchley Park stripes,   
And what’s more – unawares  
You witnessed my triumph.  
I realised that code has no memory:  
Each rune is a single transmission of intent  
With no inference or relation  
To what it may or may not have meant  
previously. Refer only to its present tense as  
This is your entire world, complete.  
  
Kaddish must be said over  
All talk about forgiveness,  
Limkhol v’lo lishkoakh.  
We must leave our scars  
To the wind, our projections  
To the past: this is the essential key  
To clothes, ladders and belltowers.  
  
You laughed off my suggestion,  
Half idle,   
That you take up campanology  
In retirement.  
Half idle – the habit I slid into  
When we met, on rare occasion,  
To help you dress  
Your own discomfort  
In something civil,  
More tolerable.   
Yet today you let me wear  
My own clothes.  
  
I know I am  
the burden of your guilt  
In human form;  
You see nothing   
But a crown of regret  
On your own face  
Each time you see mine.  
  
Despite my ungodly hours,  
Tonight   
You didn’t go to bed:  
You stayed on the sofa,  
Flicking last week’s listings,  
Just to be near.  
  
In that moment  
From under the mask  
A flash  
Revealed a room that neither of us knew,  
Pristine: Fresh paint,   
Grout, and plastic sofa coverings.  
If I promise to be careful with the carpet  
Can we please stay here for a while?
