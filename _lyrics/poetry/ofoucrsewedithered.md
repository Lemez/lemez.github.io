Of course we dithered at the kiosk  
With affordable umbrellas,  
Slowly arm in arm we wandered  
To the gardens on the map.  
  
As the clouds spit and spattered –   
Was it sycamore or linden? –   
Well, whatever science calls you,   
Thanks for throwing out your arms,  
So generous and easy,  
Oblique and stooping like a mother  
With a warm, protective skirt.  
  
So in your folds we huddled;  
Not thinking you had chosen  
Just that spot to grow your fringe,  
So that one day, a couple, tired,  
Could take refuge in your limbs,  
And through your foresight, inch together  
To a perfect sense of calm  
In one another.
