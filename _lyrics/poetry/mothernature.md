Is it a whim that I am victim of,  
A casual decision on an arbitrary day?  
Did I annoy you, Mother Nature?  
Well how bitter now your pet name,  
gushing meadows appellation  
with its succour for the needy,   
there’s a cupcake in the oven,   
I’m a fount of warmth and nipples,   
free for all to sit and suckle;  
slake your thirst my child and revel   
in my womb of endless bounty.  
  
Your hips have borne so much  
It’s a wonder you can stand.  
How does your halo stay so clear,  
Your expression never changing?   
All that rape and malnutrition  
Must wreak havoc on your skin.  
  
Has your womb in fact run dry?   
Are you sitting on your bed, bosoms  
cold, cracked and swollen red  
tears coursing down your stitches,  
as a requiem of piss and dribble  
pools between your legs  
and the trumpet of incontinence  
calypsos your demise?  
  
Or are your eyes wet with anger just   
as mine are, dimly gazing at the rhino-   
plastic bag that dares to occupy your jacket,  
nodding meek acquiescence in a drooping false moustache,   
making idle plans for God-knows-who’s  
tomorrow in your stead? Do you think,   
Mother Nature, you and I – we might be dead?
