In the itchy gloom,  
I squatted down  
To interrupt  
the torrent of pleasant  
white elephants.  
Anxious to speak,  
But afraid to sit  
On that fragile perch  
I knew my words would  
flail at small talk,  
lead with their elbows,  
flooring decorum.  
  
Although your hair was bereavement white,  
You seemed much younger,  
A little girl at a party  
you could barely understand.  
I’m sorry for grabbing out for you  
In the fog of music and make believe  
To still my sea of lurching guts,  
When your cap’n was under ground,  
Overboard.  
  
Thank God as I write this   
For the vaguely pretty almost blonde  
To glance at, to come up for air,  
Or else my lower back would snap with  
The bitterness of it all.
