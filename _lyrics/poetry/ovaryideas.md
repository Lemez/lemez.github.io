I dreamt last night  
Ideas were eggs.  
We are born with each one  
In our ovary heads,  
A finite lot that grow  
From willowy follicles  
To be spat out monthly:  
Each one a clock-happy seed  
Of miracle or annoyance.  
  
It makes me desperate  
To think of how  
I shat them out mechanically,   
Bleeding for a cheap laugh or  
Worse, those I blotted out in cotton wool   
Because I didn’t like their timing.  
  
Knowing what I do now,  
I wish my body would have ached  
For days in advance,  
Forewarning the rush of potential:  
I would have cleansed myself,  
Jubilant, locked the door,  
Teased it out with jasmine,  
wine and tenderness.  
  
And only when it   
Had uttered its  
Very last drop   
Would I have understood  
If, at last, I should  
Change life’s linen.
