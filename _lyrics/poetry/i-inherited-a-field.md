I inherited a field  
Some place distant I didn’t know.  
Hardly appropriate for an urban lad,  
But there it is. First I was overjoyed.  
Rolling countryside, fertile plains,     
A million givers of life,   
Nature’s yellowing display of effervescent beauty.  
My very own umbilical cord  
To past and future.  
But then I paid it scant attention,  
Preferring bustle as my daily bread  
Until one day I remembered, running there in panic,  
To witness ears of corn curled skywards  
And sardonic, muffled laughter,  
More appropriate for an urban lad.
