It was on the boat to Haifa as the shoreline disappeared    
That I saw her out the corner of my eye.    
She was staring out to sea    
Drop dead gorgeous 6 foot 3    
Standing sadly waving nobody goodbye.    
So feeling trepidation I make my way across the deck    
And made some clumsy introduction like a fool.    
But little did I know that this simple conversation    
Would change everything I thought I ever knew.    
    
Oh where and when    
Will we meet again    
Bye bye bye bye bye     
My girl from Birobidzhan    
    
Her story started typically with alcohol and pregnancy    
A husband who had left her in the lurch    
So feeling desperation and not knowing what to do    
She saw an advert in the paper from the Church    
It said “Calling every Jew, by blood or marriage that’ll do,    
We’ll help you seek another life on the horizon.”    
So with what little she possessed, she put on her Sunday best    
And set off dreaming of a better life in Zion.    
    
CHORUS    
    
She smiled like a child when I asked for her address    
And told me simply I should look up ‘immigration’.    
The outcome was the same when I asked about her name    
She said “I haven’t got one yet so please be patient.    
You what is gone is gone, that was then and this is now –    
You’re not the first hero who promised he would save me.”    
So in a trail of golden hair, her perfume hanging in the air    
She disappeared and left me helpless like a baby.    
    
CHORUS    
    
My girl from Birobidzhan!
