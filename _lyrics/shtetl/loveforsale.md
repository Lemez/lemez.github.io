Love is just a commodity  
With the broker saying “Hold me, hold me.”  
Oh baby if you don’t like to speculate,  
Well, you wouldn’t leave your own front door.  
  
You can think of me as a modern matchmaker  
Helping people far and wide  
But tell me why should it be that only we get to have ourselves a Russian bride.  
  
Come for the weekend  
Hand-pick your angels  
Who in America  
You know would never even look at you  
Oh desperation  
Is so enriching,  
Compared to loneliness  
What’s a thousand dollars or two?  
  
Over candlelight and wine  
She will purr and sigh  
Like a model in a magazine  
And when you take her home to suburbia  
You’ll be living every schoolboy’s dream  
  
And when she leaves you  
Don’t ask for refunds  
Please understand  
A man like you could never make her stay  
Romance and women  
No guarantees here  
Back in America   
It’s just a different price that you pay
