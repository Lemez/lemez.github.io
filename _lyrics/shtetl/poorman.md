I get up early in the morning, work til nightfall  
They got me working seven days a week   
You don't have money you're you're not long for this island  
You're going six feet underneath  
When I am rich I'll sit around all day bone idle  
Sipping my aperitif  
Yes it's a jungle when you’re fighting for survival   
Money is the air you gotta breathe  

CHORUS  
If I wasn't such a poor man  
It'd be a different story  
Like another day is dawning  
No this isn't Jackanory  
I'm gonna give you all the glory having money can bring  
  
She’s the kind of girl who likes a man to suffer  
She lifts him up and takes him down  
She's always moving on from one man to another  
Tiptoes out the door without a sound   
She likes to lie and change her mind like all the others  
She doesn't care to play around  
But when she’s yours she is the sweetest kind of lover  
Your feet won't even touch the ground  

CHORUS  
  
1 2 3 4 5  
Get some cash and stay alive  
6 7 8 9 10  
Then do it again  
  
In her arms you’ll go from ecstasy to sorrow  
Only she can make you feel like a man  
She likes today but she don’t understand tomorrow  
Money’s got a short attention span  

CHORUS
