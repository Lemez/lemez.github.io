I walk in -   
How long’s it been ? -   
Long enough:   
Your jaw it hits the floor.  
Look at you, a chick or two,  
The Cadillac is parked outside the door.  
I’m not here to waste your time or tell you what to do.  
You and I together we’ve got nothing more to lose.  
  
CHORUS  
If we only ever believe in one thing  
If we only ever make this one leap  
Why don’t we try and live for one day,  
Like a butterfly, fly away,  
Fly away.  
  
Before your eyes  
You see in me  
A mirror to a time   
You’re trying to forget.  
Sometimes I dream of make believe  
No matter where I’ve gone  
There’s nothing to regret.  
Back when I was young   
I showed disdain to every man.  
Now I don’t discriminate,  
Just because I can.  
  
CHORUS
