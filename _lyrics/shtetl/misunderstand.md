I can sing a song of sixpence  
Or however much you like  
I can sing a song to make you feel like   
Cheating on your wife.  
When I’m finished you’ll find out  
Exactly what your life’s about  
And your pockets inside out.  
  
Well I’m just an old romantic  
Who is in love with make believe  
Life has taught me that the more you want  
The more you have to weave  
Where the wine and laughs are flowing  
That’s exactly where I’ll be  
And I’m always the last to leave.   
  
CHORUS  
Don’t misunderstand me,  
Wait before you turn and walk away  
I’m not a bad man  
I’m just feeling kind of cynical today.  
  
When I’m dining in society  
I use my royal name.  
Well your wife would just adore  
My little chateau on the Seine.  
But before we all retire  
To my villa on the hill  
Well would you mind to pay the bill?  
  
If you need a friendly shoulder  
I’m your best friend in the world  
If your feel are feeling cold  
I know a very friendly girl  
Well I never had a brother   
Who was half as good to me  
You’re like my second family.  
  
CHORUS  
  
No, no, no, don’t misunderstand me!
