She was a Queen   
Fairer than Esther  
Barely a girl  
the angels had blessed her  
But something inside me died each time as I undressed her.  
  
Although in my heart  
I knew it was fleeting  
She whispered her love  
At every meeting  
And swore she would kill me if she ever caught me cheating  
  
One day coming home  
The cold made me shiver  
I saw by her door  
Some boys from yeshiva  
In front of my eyes a trickle turned into a river.    

The power of prayer   
Is all we require  
To harness our fears  
And vanquish desire  
With help from the heavens man will always quench his fire  
  
And so through the haze  
My fists had opinions  
Dispensing advice   
To my love and her minions  
And when we were through I sent them packing for the minyan.  
  
And then all was still  
And nothing divided  
My angel and I  
At last reunited  
I wept as I taught her  
True love needs to be requited.
