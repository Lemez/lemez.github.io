Today its gonna be a good day  
Today its gonna be a good day  
Today its gonna be a good  
Good good good good day  

Today is my lucky day    
I saw it in the cereal:  
The stars are all aligned for me  
Today  
Is gonna go my way.  

CHORUS
I havent had a call from destiny  
It's just that in a flash  
Ive realised theres nothing in my way  
I t doesnt mean I live in amke believe  
But life and love will all turn out OK  

Last night the moon asked me to dance  
She had a bottle in her pocket  
That was full of velvet promises  
We drank it dry and lay there side by side  
Til the sunrise.  

CHORUS
I havent had a call from destiny  
It's just that in a flash
Ive realised theres nothing in my way  
I t doesnt mean I live in make believe  
But life and love will all turn out OK.
