press: ["...second track Rabbit Not A Man is so frighteningly, impossibly, balls to the wall AWESOME. The only time on the E.P Lazlo seems to cut loose and not worry about sounding utterly mental, over a wall of savage, power pop guitar riffs, one note keyboard lines and an utterly thrilling sense of momentum that never lets up. Itâ€™s completely wonderful...", "AAAMusic"]

CHORUS
I'm a rabbit not a man  
With a carrot in my hand  
Come sail away with me  
We will start a rabbit colony    

The rabbit stays at home  
His field is overgrown  
He won't go out alone  

Oh to be a hare-brained guy  
Who doesn't question why  
He gets the call to go forth and multiply  

On a summer's day  
Girls and playboys play  
And bunny boils away  

CHORUS  

Rabbits all around  
Heads fall to the ground  
I think in pen and ink  
Draw what can be found  

Bunnies live in colours black and gold  
They dont wait for Disney  
Afraid of getting old  

I wont freeze in the headlights  
Confuse my wife for a deadline  
Growing higher and higher  
Three leaves on every clover  
And my cup runneth over  
And my cup is running over
