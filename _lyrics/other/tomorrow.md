By the time I leave tomorrow  
I hope I"ll know what all of this is for.  
My clothes will all be borrowed  
From someone who has travelled  
Down this road I'm going on before.  

By the time I leave tomorrow  
Could you find it in your heart to forgive  
These words that ring so hollow -  
There's nothing left but silence,  
I've given everything I have to give.

CHORUS
See the arc of a rainbow  
Kaleidoscope of colours in the sky  
Could I be your hero  
Or do I need to ask the reason why?  
Oh, why?  

When we wave goodbye tomorrow  
Please don't wear that red dress that I love.  
Through all the joys and sorrow,  
One day we'll be together  
On this earth or in the one above.
