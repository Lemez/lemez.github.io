I'm not the kind of guy  
Who's used to being by myself.  
When I arrive in a room  
All the people go "Mmm!,  
I want one of those!"  
No other food  
Is as good at improving your mood.  
Turn a wintry night  
To a feeling of holding you warm and snug and tight.  
There's noone luckier than a latke.  

For the rest of the year  
People eat other things  
Like lettuce and ryvita.  
They crave me but save me   
For that one special time of the year.  
I know I'm not part of any diet  
But Chanukah without me:  
Do you really think anyone would actually buy it?  
No, there's noone luckier than a latke.
