CHORUS:
She's Venus  
My girl  
with a penis.  

Miss Aphrodite woke up one morning  
Took off her nightie, tired and yawning.  
Washed her face in front of the mirror,  
Just an ordinary day.  

Come in Mars - he's in his pyjamas.  
He's kamikaze, and not into dramas.  
Looks at the sun coming in through the window,  
she's got something important to say.  

CHORUS
