Something happened  
Coming home today  
My neck got broken  
In an almost accidental kind of way.   
I’m not angry:  
I guess it happens all the time.  
That will teach me  
To stick it out and lay it on the line  
  
CHORUS  
Now I should turn the other cheek  
Like it’s all that I deserve.  
Pay the price for talking cheap  
Saying I’m the one to blame.  
On the outside looking in,  
It’s you and I alone together.  
One by one we roll the dice  
In our plastic paradise.  
  
Life’s so funny  
If you understand the joke,  
But I’m so tired  
Of never seeing fire where there’s smoke.  
See I’m dyslexic   
When the writing’s on the wall,  
Apologetic  
When the moment for apology is gone.

CHORUS
