What kind of path was it  
That brought us to this place?  
So far from that first kiss  
To this emptiness  
How did all our trust  
Fall down between the cracks?  
Can we ever comprehend  
How it came to that…  
  
Baby baby dry your eyes,  
Guess it wasn’t meant to be  
I can only rationalize,  
See you in another life.  
When all has turned to grey,  
We’ll be born again as birds,  
Learn how to fly away  
And life won’t be so absurd.  
  
Last you held me near  
The memories made me freeze  
Throwing motions absently  
In a parody  
As we lie side by side  
The water rushes in  
Seems like a bridge too far   
Beyond the place we’re in  
  
So I guess we found the line  
Where you and I begin  
Stepped over the other side  
Wish we could start again
