You ask me  
Why it is I come to you  
When someone else is just as good   
I asked them but they said the same  
Didn't even ask my name  
	
Explain to me   
Just what it is you have to lose   
Take a minute in my shoes    
Don't you feel like you've paid your dues    
Already    

I'll show you   
That all our fates are so entwined   
Don't lose your faith in humankind    
Just don't forget my state of mind   
Is fragile   

Together   
We can enjoy the taste of dignity    
As long as you believe in me    
I'll show you my reality    
I've seen a few   

You ask me   
Why it is I come to you   
When someone else is just as good   
I asked them but they said the same   
Didn't even ask my name   
   
Oh just another refugee
