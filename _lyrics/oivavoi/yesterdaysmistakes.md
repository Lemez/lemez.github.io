Don’t need another resolution  
To feel as though I’m going somewhere.  
  
You said you needed me,  
Or at least that’s what I thought.  
At times the memories  
Seem to be knocking at my door.  
I’ve seen the film a million times  
Feels like I wrote the storyline  
I refuse to replay  
The mistakes that we made yesterday.  
  
They were yesterday's mistakes  
  
I like to think I’m stronger now  
Victim of common sense  
The truth is that I know I still  
Confuse the past with the present tense  
Condensing what we had  
To a single frame  
That sticks in my mind  
When I try to move on  
The same image comes back every time  
    
They were yesterday's mistakes   
  
Forgive my selfishness  
I’d be grateful if you can  
Forget my ingratitude  
You think I’m twice the girl I am  
They say we should forgive  
And not forget  
What has gone before  
I refuse to replay  
The mistakes that we made yesterday  
  
They were yesterday's mistakes
