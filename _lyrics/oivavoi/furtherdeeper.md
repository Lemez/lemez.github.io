I feel deflated  
Let down by heroes  
Walls of silence  
Soak up the echoes  
Of my ideals,  
Sold down the river.  
I blame my own naïve behaviour,  
Time again, I’m a complete beginner.  
  
I have a theory,  
Too complicated   
To explain now  
Don’t make me waste it  
But you should realise that  
For your freedom  
I might just hurt you  
But I didn’t mean to.  
  
Our flesh and blood  
In mute agreement  
We stand like idols  
We should be kneeling  
A single signal  
I’ll flick the lever  
And we’ll all go falling   
Further, deeper.  
  
When the day comes calling,   
That’s when we’ll go
Falling down.
