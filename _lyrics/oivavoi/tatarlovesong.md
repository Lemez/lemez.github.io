about: "At the time I wrote this, we didn't have a female singer. Luckily, my sister Anna was an in-demand dance music vocalist. Happy days. The melody was inspired by a traditional song I heard in a recording by the mesmerising Ukrainian Tatar guitarist Enver Ismailov. Recorded at Livingston Studios, London."

I knew that when I met you  
I never could forget you  
We stole our moments so naturally  
Cos time was irrelevant bathing in benevolence  
I felt you made me complete  
But then you said you're leaving for pastures that are greener   
To better yourself and to be free  
Despite my reservations concerning our relations  
I dont think I can just wait and see  

I guess I was naive and ready to believe  
That we could dance off into the sun  
That's why I write this letter to understand you better  
To try and show you what we have done  
If we go on this journey that promises eternity  
How can I know that it's for real?  
It's you and I together, no if or but or whether  
We'll find a way if it's meant to be  

Call me a romantic, incurable pedantic  
But all I want is to comprehend  
If I no longer miss you then why do I still kiss you  
In daydreams that I don't want to end  
Against my own volition I had a premonition  
Embracing fate and all of her qualms  
We'll lose our inhibiton and follow intuition  
And die a death in each other's arms  

Some may call it destiny or some kind of entity  
Looking out for us up above  
Just one word from you would help me think it through  
To see if I want your type of love  
If we go on this journey that promises eternity  
How can I know that it's for real?  
It's you and I together, no if or but or whether,  
We'll find a way if it's meant to be  

CHORUS
All I want to do is immerse myself in you  
All I need from you is a tender word or two  
All I need from you is the stregnth to see it through  
Help me just a little I dont know what to do  

When I'm in your arms I'm invincible baby  
I want you forever, I'm tired of waiting.
