When I need you beside me, I can do things to myself I regret.  
My thoughts become distant, my mind turns everything right on its head.  
I search in vain for the positive, to stop all the demons from talking aloud.  
It’s not that I’m lost, it’s just there are times I don’t want to be found.  

CHORUS  
I’m feeling my way  
One step at a time  
I know that you’re there  
But I can’t always find you.  
The next thing I know,  
The circus begins  
And I’m walking along  
Doing anything not to look down.  
  
Don’t let go my hand,   
I’m doing anything not to look down.  
  
When I need you beside me, at times I’m afraid that I don’t know the cost.  
I focus my thoughts, or at least those that I hope I can trust.  
I start to feel all the maybes slowly spiral inside my chest.  
Guess I’m no good at perspective so I should admit this is what I do best.  
  
CHORUS
