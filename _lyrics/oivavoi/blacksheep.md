I’ve had enough of all the clichés  
Out of sight is out of my mind  
I’ve had enough of all the life-changing advice  
They invent to pull the wool over my eyes.  
I’ve had enough of all the clichés  
The thought that nothing is ever enough  
I’m fine until the fears – they catch me unawares –  
Creep up and start to whisper sweet nothings in my ears.  

CHORUS  
I’m sending out this tune  
To places I once knew  
To all the people I have lost  
I’m sending out this tune  
To another space and time  
To another day in my life.  
  
I’ve had enough of all the clichés  
Sticks and stones they never break me in  
But every single word, no matter how absurd,  
Leaves the faintest trace under my skin.  
I’ve had enough of all the clichés  
I don’t assume the things I cannot see.  
I try not to be rash – to ponder all the facts –  
But false conclusions always seem to jump to me.  
  
CHORUS
  
Makes no difference  
When I try  
The numbers all  
Multiply
