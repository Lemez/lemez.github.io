(Soviet radio sample)  
This is Moscow speaking. All radio transmitters in the USSR are broadcasting. We have received news from the State news agency TASS about the world's first ever flight of man in space. 

I am a rocket  
The power of a system  
It's bullet-proof technology  
We're going to a new world, going to a better place  

This is just the first step  
Everyone will follow me  
Hold me up as an example  
There's no need to watch my back as my friends have got it for me  

I'm going to go down in history  
As the man who made a difference  
Call me egotistical?  
Well how dare you call me selfish - I'm doing this for mankind  

Yes i am a rocket  
A child of the motherland  
Pioneer for humanity  
I'm a wholesome superhero for the worldwide society  

CHORUS  
We're heading out to outer space.  
We're going forth for the human race.  

I am a prodigy  
A part of the masterplan  
A symbol of equality  
Blasting out into the future - I'm the man defying gravity  

They'll build me a monument  
Name everything after me  
Schools and hospitals, armies of boys and girls  
I'm going to live forever -  immortality is mine.  
  
CHORUS  

(Radio)  
Cosmonaut pilot of the spaceship Sputnik Vostok is a citizen of the USSR, Pilot Major Yuri Alexeyevich Gagarin.
