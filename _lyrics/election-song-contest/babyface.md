I know you may be taken now,  
One less fish in the sea.  
I need a man who knows more than how  
To boost efficiency.  
See I haven't felt like this,  
Since I was a little girl,  
I was reeling like the economy,  
My feelings in a whirl.  
So when I get to the ballot box on polling day,  
This is what I'll say:  

CHORUS  
I want a man  
A man to be strong  
A man to drive me wild  
Both a lover and a child  
Oh David, you're my baby face.  

I know they say you're all the same  
Each one as bad as the rest  
I don't care what your MPs claim  
When I'm lying here undressed.  
Together you and I  
We can paint this whole town blue  
I can't vote for any other  
Cos the only one is you.  
So when I get to the ballot box on polling day,  
This is what I'll say.  

CHORUS
