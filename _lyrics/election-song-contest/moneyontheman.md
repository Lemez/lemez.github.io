---
When judgement day comes knocking on your door  
You know who to vote for.

Those boys in blue  
Don't got a clue  
They ain't been out the starting gate in years.  
Them other fellas  
Them ones in yella  
If they get into power it all will end in tears.  

But Gordon Brown  
Prime Minister  
He runs that ship  
West Minister  
Some say his smile is sinister  
But I put my money on the man at Number Ten.  

I ain't got a dollar in my pocket  
These days folks don't got that much to spend  
But if I had a dime  
In these god-forsaken times  
I put my money on the man at Number Ten.  
  
Them UKIP peeps  
Give me the creeps  
From the heart of England comes a nasty smell.  
As for the Greens -   
Well as they means -   
We all know that they don't got a chance in hell.  
But Gordon Brown  
He's built to last  
Like some colossus from the ancient past.  
As for the others  
Well who can be arsed?  
But I put my money on the man at Number Ten.  

Now I live my life in desperation  
Lost my job and I ain't got no friends  
If you're a betting man  
And you're looking for salvation  
Put your money on the man at Number Ten.
