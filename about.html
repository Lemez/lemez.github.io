  <span class="newthought">Hello. </span></p>
  <p>I'm a musician, linguist<span class="sidenote-number"></span> and hacker with a special interest in anthropology, politics and education.
<span class="sidenote topmargin">To varying degrees: Russian, French, Serbo-Croatian, Hebrew, Arabic, Japanese, Hungarian, Tamil,  Ruby, Javascript, Python.</span> </p>
<p>Here you can find some things about me<span class="sidenote-number"></span>, not least that someone once made me customised tins of Russian condensed milk, сгущёнка.<span class="sidenote">Just to be clear, I'm not <a href="http://nypost.com/2015/01/04/harlem-man-dies-in-six-floor-plunge/"  >this person</a> or <a href="http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/04/jonathan-walton-named-memorial-church-minister"  >this person.</a> And if you want the "About This Site" page, that's <a href="{{thissite[0].url}}">here.</a></span></p>

<!-- <p>If there are some things that aren't clear, don't worry - there will be notes.<span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote topmargin">I have a thing for academics, you should know.

<p><span class="newthought">In no particular order, I'm interested in</span> folklore and ritual culture, radical education, human languages, singing and vocal techniques, sound, acoustics, absurdist literature, identity politics, language acquisition and loss, dance and the body, computational linguistics, storytelling and children's culture, statistics, computer hacking, censorship, Russia and the former Soviet Union, India, Roma and Jewish issues, liminal spaces, sacred music, infrasound, social structures, ownership and art as activism.</p>

<h3>Bands</h3>
<p>I spent many years of my life running bands, performing on stage and touring. It is still something I love to do. I got some great artwork out of it. From my first band <a href="{{ovvpage[0].url}}">Oi Va Voi</a>, I got to see a glimpse of the rock'n'roll touring life. It was my education - as a professional songwriter, bandleader and co-producer alongside top producers and industry folks.</p> 
<p>My next band <a href="{{shtetlpage[0].url}}">Shtetl Superstars</a> was formed as a satirical response to the wave of racist sentiment in the UK.</p>  
<p>My last band <a href="{{ytopage[0].url}}">Yiddish Twist Orchestra</a> was a continuation of this feeling: an art project that uses London social history to tell a truthy story about the hybrid mix of immigrant Yiddish, West Indian and Latin sounds in London's Soho at the dawn of the rock'n'roll era. </p>

<h3>Artists and Songs</h3>

<p>There are plenty of ways to write a song. As a poetry graduate, I lean towards writing lyrics and then setting them to music rather than the other way round.</p>

{% include sideimage img='Alec_kopyt2.jpg' text='The man with the golden sandpaper voice, Alik Kopyt' %}

<p>I've produced a few <a href="/music.html">artists</a> over the years, and it has helped me to understand a thing or two about performance, particularly vocals. Whether blessed with a voice like an <a href="{{bg[0].url}}">angel</a> or as rough as <a href="{{alik[0].url}}">sandpaper</a>, the best recordings have been with artists who understand that singing behind a mic and singing on stage are one and the same. That kickstarted my interest in working with singers, and I've since learnt a lot more about the mechanics of the voice. It never ceases to amaze me how magical the voice is, and how we can create different resonances and voice types by constricting our muscles and obstructing our airways in different ways. </p>

<p>As an aside, learning Sanskrit is a fantastic way to really understand voice production, and how the entire vocal tract works. Each piece of articulation (each sound and letter) in the language is organised into groups according to the place in the throat or mouth that it is produced, and it makes you deeply aware of how to make each sound sparkle. More information about Sanskrit and sound is easy to find, but to get you started, here's an <a href="http://sciencedevelopments.blogspot.in/2008/03/cleft-palate-sanskrit-helps-speech.html">article</a> about how it can be used as a precise diagnostic tool for speech therapists.</p>


<h3>Theatre, Film and Others</h3>
<p>My first degree was in Russian and French literature, specialising in poetry and drama, and I've spent many a happy hour in a dark theatre watching magic unfold on stage. Watching actors and musicians bring your ideas to life is one of the greatest compositional thrills I know.  </p>
<p>I was a  partner in a central London music studio, <a href="http://landfmusic.com/"  >Lemez & Fridel</a> for some years, and we worked with all sorts of wonderful artists for their albums, theatre productions and TV spots.</p>

<h3>Current Projects</h3>

<p>I'm currently learning the vocal repertoire of Carnatic music in South India, researching music and medicine in Indian traditions, and working with music and sound in special needs education. I'm the son of an anaesthetist, so you could say it's in my haemoglobin.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">I love</span> radio. Back in the day, BBC World Service were nice enough to let a bolshy graduate in off the street pitch a feature about music and politics in Ukraine, and I never looked back. I've produced and presented feature documentaries and reports for BBC World Service, BBC Russian Service, BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3, CBC Canada, Resonance FM, and helped to set up OpenAir at SOAS, University of London.</p>

<p>I was part of a small indie TV & film production company in Jerusalem for two years. We made cultural reports and documentaries, and sold them mostly to Scandinavian broadcasters (apparently not much happens up there). Our proudest moment was winning the Audience Prize at Nyon Film Festival for <a href="http://www.7thart.com/films/In-the-Shadow-of-King-David"  >a film about archaeology and politics.</a></p>

<h3>Education</h3>
<section id='education'>

<blockquote>Everyone should learn how to programme a computer, because computers teach you how to think.</blockquote>

<p>That's a quote from everyone's favourite deity, Steve Jobs: but old Jobsy forget to mention one thing - if you only learn to think like a computer, then you are screwed for life.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs made us all love computers. I wish it were anthropology or languages instead. Technology and computer-think teaches us nothing about each other, and everything about a rational, binary world that bears no relation to the world we live in. To learn coding is a useful skill today, much as running was during the Viking invasion. It could well get our kids a job, but encouraging us all to spend more time with machines and less time with each other leads to a dystopian future that I want my children to stay well away from. </p>

<p>I'm particularly interested in the philosophies of Paolo Freire, Sri Aurobindo's integral education and the gurulkul system of Indian arts practice. </p>

<p>My language-learning startup <a href="http://tonguesten.com">Tonguesten</a> was a radical attempt to allow kids to learn languages using the music videos and online videos that they consume anyway, effectively leading towards a DIY text book, personalised for each student according to their tastes.</p>

 <p>It was a wild ride while it lasted, and it left me with a deep respect for computational linguistics, and a deep distaste for UK educational policy and the cynicism with which technology business try to exploit the ringfenced funding within the education sector. Sadly for the educational technology scene, proving that your app actually helps kids to learn takes a long study conducted under clinical conditions, and investors would rather you got something out there to make a quick return, so noone really bothers. And while the UK government continues to promote shiny, new technologies like magpies on heat, the real effect of technology on our kids' education becomes a moot point.</p>

 <p>In reality, education technology is marketed as a budget-saver, and the we all know that teachers themselves are the most expensive part of any school. So, much like the CEOs of Silicon Valley, I'll send my own children to Steiner, Waldorf or Krishnamurthy schools, where class sizes are small, kids get a lot of personal attention, and the school is smart enough to leave the shiny gadgets for computer class, once or twice a week, and no more.</p>

<p>Please understand: this is not the One True Table. Such a style does not exist. One must craft each data table with custom care to the narrative one is telling with that specific data. So take this not as "the table style to use", but rather as "a table style to start from". From here, use principles to guide you: avoid chartjunk, optimize the data-ink ratio ("within reason", as Tufte says), and <span class="sidenote-number">"mobilize every graphical element, perhaps several times over, to show the data."</span><span class="sidenote">Page 139, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, Edward Tufte 2001.</span> Know when to reach for more complex data presentation tools, like a custom graphic or a JavaScript charting library.</p> -->

<p>Tufte CSS uses <span class="code">h1</span> for the document title, <span class="code">h2</span> for section headings, and <span class="code">h3</span> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
<p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn't require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
<footer><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">Edward Tufte, forum post, 'Book design: advice and examples' thread</a></footer>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="newthought">In his <span class="sidenote-number">later books</span></span><span class="sidenote">E.g. <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be">Beautiful Evidence</a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and sets the first few words of the sentence in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <span class="code">newthought</span>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. The vertical space is accomplished separately, through the <span class="code">&lt;section&gt;</span> class. I feel the vertical space is unnecessary when using this technique to replace <span class="code">h2</span> elements, as in this paragaph. Be consistent: though I do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <span class="code">newthought</span> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

<h3>Color</h3>
<p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. I picked <span class="code">#fffff8</span> and <span class="code">#111111</span> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their 'pure' cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. </p>
<p>Other forms of text&mdash;for instance, links and code&mdash;are slightly lighter, and sidenote numbers are bright red to distinguish them from inline text.</p>

<h3>Font</h3>
<p>In print, Tufte uses the proprietary <span class="sidenote-number">Monotype Bembo</span><span class="sidenote">See Tufte's response in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. In digital formats he uses ETBembo, which Tufte CSS includes using <span class="code">@font-face</span>. This means you'll have to make the .ttf file available to your readers. Note that <a href="https://github.com/daveliepmann/tufte-css/commit/0a810a7d5f4707941c6f9fe99a53ec41f50a5c00">thanks to Linjie Ding</a>, italicized text uses the ETBembo Italic font instead of mechanically skewing the characters.</p>
<p>Code snippets (using the <span class="code">code</span> class) ape GitHub's font selection and sans-serifs (with the <span class="sans">sans</span> class) follow Tufte's choice of Gill Sans.</p> -->





<!-- <section>
<h2>Sidenotes</h2>
<p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte's style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<span class="sidenote-number"></span><span class="sidenote">This is a sidenote.</span> Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
<p>On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. Sidenotes consist of 1) a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and 2) a sidenote containing content that repeats the superscripted number to reinforce its connection to the text. To add the former, just put <span class="code">&lt;span class="sidenote-number"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span> where you want the reference to go. Immediately after that goes the <span class="code">span</span> with class <span class="code">sidenote</span>, inserted directly into the middle of the <span class="code">p</span> tag containing the referent text. This will give the sidenote the correct height.</p>
<p><span class="marginnote">This is a margin note. Notice there isn't a number preceding the note.</span>If you don't want footnote-style numberings on your sidenotes, what you want is a margin note. They are currently identical to sidenotes but are kept semantically distinct because one might wish to style them separately. Figures in the margin are created as margin notes, as demonstrated in the next section.</p>

<p class="code">qplot(wt, mpg, data = mtcars, colour = factor(cyl))</p>
<figure class="fullwidth">
<img src="{{IMAGE_PATH}}/figure2.png"/>
<figcaption>Figure 2: Full width figure</figcaption>

<br/>

<figure>
  <img src="{{IMAGE_PATH}}/figure3.png"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 3: A figure the width of the main column</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
</section> -->



<!--  <section>
<h2>Code</h2>
<p>Code samples are monospace using the <span class="code">code</span> class, as I've been using in this document to denote HTML tags like the word 'code' earlier in this sentence. Code blocks use that class in conjunction with the <span class="code">pre</span> tag, which gives us indentation too:</p>
<pre class="code">
;; functional programming:
(map tufte-style all-the-things)

// imperative programming:
for (i = 0; i++; i <= num) {
all_the_things[i].useTufteStyle();
}
</pre>
